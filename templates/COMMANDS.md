• Docs: ACTIVE_WORK.md updated today

RECOMMENDATIONS:
→ Consider fixing remaining ESLint warnings
→ Ready for new feature development
```

## 📁 Command Structure

Commands are stored in `.claude/commands/` directory:

```
.claude/
└── commands/
    ├── hygiene
    ├── todo
    ├── design
    ├── next
    ├── commit
    ├── learn
    ├── docs
    ├── estimate
    ├── version-tag
    ├── reflect
    ├── defer
    ├── push

```

Each command is a shell script that Claude Code can execute directly.

## 🛠️ Implementation Template

### Basic Command Structure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Command: [name]
# Purpose: [description]

# Validation
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: /[command] <arguments>"
    exit 1
fi

# Main logic
[command-specific implementation]

# Output formatting
echo "✅ [Command] completed successfully"
```

### Integration with Claude Code
Commands should:
- Provide clear success/failure feedback
- Update appropriate documentation files
- Follow project conventions
- Handle edge cases gracefully
