# Validation-First Steering Implementation

## Problem Addressed
AI assistant was making claims about code functionality without testing, violating core development principles and leading to unreliable responses.

## Solution Implemented
Created comprehensive validation-first steering rules to prevent functionality claims without proof.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced tone.md with Circuit Breaker Rule
- Added mandatory validation checklist at the top
- Implemented "STOP. Run a test. Show the results." principle
- Created validation-first principles section
- Made validation requirements impossible to miss

### 2. Created validation.md Steering File
- Dedicated validation-focused steering document
- Pre-response validation checklist
- Forbidden phrases without testing
- Required phrases when untested
- Violation recovery process

### 3. Key Validation Principles Established
- **Never claim functionality without demonstrating it through testing**
- **Exit codes matter more than file contents** (0 = success, non-zero = failure)
- **Proof over inference** - actual results trump logical deduction
- **File contents â‰  working functionality**

## Testing Validation
- Ran full test suite: 189 tests passed, 0 failed (exit code 0)
- Confirmed steering system loads validation.md automatically
- Verified validation rules are active in AI responses

## Expected Impact
- Eliminates claims about code functionality without testing
- Forces demonstration of actual behavior vs assumptions
- Creates systematic validation habits
- Prevents unreliable responses about code status

## Enforcement Mechanism
- Circuit breaker rule stops AI from making claims without testing
- Pre-response checklist validates every functionality claim
- Forbidden/required phrases guide appropriate language
- Violation recovery process handles mistakes

## Documentation
- All changes documented in this implementation record
- Steering files include clear examples and requirements
- Testing requirements explicitly defined
- Recovery procedures established for violations
