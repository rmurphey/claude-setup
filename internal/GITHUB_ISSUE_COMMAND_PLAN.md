# GitHub Issue Command Plan

## Executive Summary
- **Current Need**: Streamline workflow for working on specific GitHub issues
- **Target Solution**: `/issue <number>` command that sets up complete issue context
- **Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks
- **Key Focus Areas**: GitHub integration, branch management, context gathering

## Problem Statement

Developers frequently need to:
- Switch context to work on specific GitHub issues
- Create appropriate branches for issue work
- Gather issue context (description, comments, related files)
- Track progress on issue resolution
- Link commits and PRs back to the original issue

Currently this requires manual GitHub navigation, branch creation, and context switching.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Issue Fetching**: Get issue details from GitHub API
- **Branch Management**: Create appropriately named branches
- **Context Setup**: Prepare workspace with issue information
- **Progress Tracking**: Link work back to the issue
- **Multi-Repository**: Handle issues from different repos

### Non-functional Requirements
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamless API integration
- **Performance**: Fast issue lookup and context setup
- **Security**: Secure token handling
- **Offline Capability**: Work with cached issue data when possible

## Technical Approach

### Command Structure
```
/issue <number> [repo]
/issue 123                    # Issue from current repo
/issue 456 owner/other-repo   # Issue from different repo
/issue list                   # List open issues
/issue current                # Show current issue context
```

### Implementation Components

#### 1. GitHub API Integration
```javascript
// lib/github/api.js
- fetchIssue(repo, number)
- listIssues(repo, filters)
- createBranch(repo, branchName, baseBranch)
- linkCommitToIssue(repo, issueNumber, commitSha)
```

#### 2. Issue Context Management
```javascript
// lib/github/context.js
- setupIssueWorkspace(issue)
- createIssueNotes(issue)
- trackIssueProgress(issueNumber)
- generateBranchName(issue)
```

#### 3. Claude Command Integration
```markdown
# .claude/commands/issue.md
- Parse issue number/repo from user input
- Fetch issue details via GitHub API
- Create working branch
- Setup context documentation
- Update ACTIVE_WORK.md with issue focus
```

## Cost Estimate

**Size**: Medium
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks (8-12 days)
**Confidence**: High

### Complexity Factors
- **Medium**: GitHub API integration and authentication
- **Low**: Command structure and documentation
- **Medium**: Branch management and git operations
- **Low**: Context setup and workspace management

### Resource Requirements
- **1 Developer**: Full-stack development
- **GitHub API Access**: Personal access token or GitHub App
- **Testing Environment**: Multiple repos for validation

## Testing Strategy

### Integration Testing
- **GitHub API**: Test with various issue types and states
- **Branch Operations**: Validate branch creation and naming
- **Multi-repo**: Test cross-repository functionality
- **Authentication**: Verify token handling and permissions

### User Experience Testing
