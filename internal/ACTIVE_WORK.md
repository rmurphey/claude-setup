# Active Work - Internal Development

## Current Session Focus
- [x] Implement dual directory structure for internal vs external documentation
- [x] Separate development records from user-facing templates
- [x] Ensure clean npm package distribution
- [x] Fix ERR_REQUIRE_ESM error by converting to ES modules
- [x] Refactor CLI to modular architecture
- [ ] Add support for GitHub Codespaces
- [ ] Implement GitHub issue command

## Development Insights
*Use this space to capture learnings about working ON this project*

### ES Module Conversion (2025-01-05)
- GitHub issue #1 caused by inquirer v9+ being ES module only
- Converted entire codebase from CommonJS to ES modules
- Key changes: package.json "type": "module", all imports/exports updated
- CLI execution logic needed simplification for ES modules

### Modular Architecture (2025-01-05)
- Extracted language setup into lib/languages/ modules
- Reduced CLI complexity from 495 to 459 lines
- Each language module exports default with setup function

## Architecture Decisions
*Document decisions about the setup tool itself*

### Language Support Architecture
- Each language in separate module (lib/languages/)
- Consistent interface: export default { setup }
- Detection logic remains in main CLI
- Allows easy addition of new languages

## Quick Capture

- [ ] [2025-01-04 22:15] add support for github codespaces
- [x] [2025-01-04 22:16] create a command for working on a specific github issue - PLANNED
- [x] [2025-01-05 14:30] fix ERR_REQUIRE_ESM error - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-01-05 14:45] refactor CLI to modular architecture - COMPLETED

## Session History
- **2025-01-04**: Implemented dual directory structure to separate internal development records from user templates
- **2025-01-05**: Fixed ES module conversion and refactored CLI architecture
