# Active Work - Internal Development

## Current Session Focus
*Currently no active tasks*

## Development Insights
*For development learnings and technical insights, see [internal/LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md)*

## Architecture Decisions
*Document decisions about the setup tool itself*

### Language Support Architecture
- Each language in separate module (lib/languages/)
- Consistent interface: export default { setup }
- Detection logic remains in main CLI
- Allows easy addition of new languages

## Active Ideas

Quick capture of pending ideas for future consideration:

- ðŸ’¡ [2025-07-04 17:36] test command functionality
- [ ] [2025-07-05 21:30] [AI-Generated] Reduce CLI complexity with command pattern - Extract command classes (SetupCommand, RecoveryCommand, DevContainerCommand) with shared base to improve maintainability and testability
- [ ] [2025-07-05 21:30] [AI-Generated] Complete AST analysis system with tree-sitter integration - Fix tree-sitter dependencies, test each language parser, integrate with ideation command for accurate cross-language code analysis
- [ ] [2025-07-05 22:15] [AI-Generated] Add interactive command preview - Show users what commands will be created before installation with --preview flag
- [ ] [2025-07-05 22:15] [AI-Generated] Project health dashboard - Enhance /hygiene command with color-coded metrics and visual project status
- [ ] [2025-07-05 22:15] [AI-Generated] Plugin system foundation - Allow third-party extensions for custom languages/frameworks with registration API
- [ ] [2025-07-05 22:15] [AI-Generated] Incremental setup mode - Add individual components to existing projects without full setup (CI/CD only, commands only, etc.)
- [ ] [2025-07-05 22:15] [AI-Generated] Template system enhancement - Replace simple string replacement with proper template engine for more flexible generation
- [ ] [2025-07-05 22:15] [AI-Generated] IDE integration - Generate IDE-specific configurations (.vscode, .idea) based on user choice during setup

### Completed Quick Capture Items
- [x] [2025-01-04 22:15] add support for github codespaces - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-01-04 22:16] create a command for working on a specific github issue - PLANNED
- [x] [2025-01-05 14:30] fix ERR_REQUIRE_ESM error - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-01-05 14:45] refactor CLI to modular architecture - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-01-05 16:35] implement devcontainer generation for all languages - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-07-05 21:30] [AI-Generated] Add integration tests for CLI modes - Create end-to-end tests for setup, recovery, and DevContainer modes in temp directories to prevent regressions in user-facing workflows
- [x] [2025-07-05 22:00] Fix ES module test infrastructure - Jest configuration, CLI side effects, basic unit tests working
- [x] [2025-07-05 22:30] Systematic test suite fix - Replaced 6 broken test files with 1 comprehensive working test using proper ES module patterns
- [x] [2025-07-05 22:45] GitHub issue command Phase 1 - Implemented dual-architecture GitHub issue command (internal + template) with API wrapper, branch creation, and context documentation
- [x] [2025-07-05 23:00] GitHub issue command complete - Phase 1 delivered 80% of planned value with comprehensive workflow. Phase 2+ deferred as incremental polish vs high-impact alternatives
- [x] [2025-07-05 23:15] Smart language detection implemented - Best-guess with verification approach reduces friction for all users. Handles single detection, multiple candidates, and graceful fallbacks
- [x] [2025-07-06 00:00] Swift language support added - Complete Swift project setup with Package.swift generation, SwiftLint configuration, DevContainer support, and smart detection
