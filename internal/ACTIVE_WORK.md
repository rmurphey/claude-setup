# Active Work - Internal Development

## Current Session Focus
- [x] Implement dual directory structure for internal vs external documentation
- [x] Separate development records from user-facing templates
- [x] Ensure clean npm package distribution
- [x] Fix ERR_REQUIRE_ESM error by converting to ES modules
- [x] Refactor CLI to modular architecture
- [x] Add support for GitHub Codespaces
- [ ] Implement GitHub issue command

## Development Insights
*Use this space to capture learnings about working ON this project*

### ES Module Conversion (2025-01-05)
- GitHub issue #1 caused by inquirer v9+ being ES module only
- Converted entire codebase from CommonJS to ES modules
- Key changes: package.json "type": "module", all imports/exports updated
- CLI execution logic needed simplification for ES modules

### Modular Architecture (2025-01-05)
- Extracted language setup into lib/languages/ modules
- Reduced CLI complexity from 495 to 459 lines
- Each language module exports default with setup function

### GitHub Codespaces Support (2025-01-05)
- Added DevContainer configuration mode to CLI
- Created templates for all 5 supported languages
- Each template includes proper base images, extensions, ports
- Documentation added to README with usage examples

## Architecture Decisions
*Document decisions about the setup tool itself*

### Language Support Architecture
- Each language in separate module (lib/languages/)
- Consistent interface: export default { setup }
- Detection logic remains in main CLI
- Allows easy addition of new languages

## Quick Capture

- [x] [2025-01-04 22:15] add support for github codespaces - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-01-04 22:16] create a command for working on a specific github issue - PLANNED
- [x] [2025-01-05 14:30] fix ERR_REQUIRE_ESM error - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-01-05 14:45] refactor CLI to modular architecture - COMPLETED
- [x] [2025-01-05 16:35] implement devcontainer generation for all languages - COMPLETED

## Session History
- **2025-01-04**: Implemented dual directory structure to separate internal development records from user templates
- **2025-01-05**: Fixed ES module conversion and refactored CLI architecture
## Ideas

Quick capture of ideas for future consideration:

- ðŸ’¡ [2025-07-04 17:36] test command functionality
- [ ] [2025-07-05 21:30] [AI-Generated] Reduce CLI complexity with command pattern - Extract command classes (SetupCommand, RecoveryCommand, DevContainerCommand) with shared base to improve maintainability and testability
- [ ] [2025-07-05 21:30] [AI-Generated] Complete AST analysis system with tree-sitter integration - Fix tree-sitter dependencies, test each language parser, integrate with ideation command for accurate cross-language code analysis
- [x] [2025-07-05 21:30] [AI-Generated] Add integration tests for CLI modes - Create end-to-end tests for setup, recovery, and DevContainer modes in temp directories to prevent regressions in user-facing workflows
- [x] [2025-07-05 22:00] Fix ES module test infrastructure - Jest configuration, CLI side effects, basic unit tests working
