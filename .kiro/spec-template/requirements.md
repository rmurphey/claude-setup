# Requirements Document

## Introduction

[Brief 1-2 paragraph description of what this feature/specification accomplishes and why it's needed. Should explain the problem being solved and high-level approach.]

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: [Main Feature Area]

**User Story:** As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [benefit/outcome].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [specific behavior/outcome]
2. WHEN [condition] THEN [component] SHALL [specific behavior with measurable criteria]
3. WHEN [condition] THEN [validation/verification requirement]
4. WHEN [condition] THEN [specific requirement with constraints]
5. IF [optional condition] THEN [conditional behavior]

### Requirement 2: [Second Feature Area]

**User Story:** As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [benefit/outcome].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [specific behavior]
2. WHEN [condition] THEN [component] SHALL [measurable requirement]
3. WHEN [condition] THEN [validation requirement]
4. IF [optional condition] THEN [conditional behavior]
5. WHEN [edge case] THEN [error handling/edge case behavior]

### Requirement 3: [Third Feature Area]

**User Story:** As a [user type], I want [capability], so that [benefit/outcome].

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN [condition] THEN [specific requirement]
2. WHEN [condition] THEN [performance/quality requirement]
3. WHEN [condition] THEN [integration requirement]
4. WHEN [condition] THEN [user experience requirement]
5. IF [condition] THEN [optional enhancement]

[Continue with additional requirements as needed - typically 3-9 requirements total]

## Notes

- Use "SHALL" for mandatory requirements, "SHOULD" for recommended, "MAY" for optional
- Include measurable criteria where possible (time limits, percentages, line counts, etc.)
- Focus on user outcomes rather than implementation details
- Each requirement should be testable and verifiable
