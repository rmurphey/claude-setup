# Design Document

## Overview

[2-3 paragraph description of the solution approach, key architectural decisions, and how it addresses the requirements. Should explain the "how" while requirements explain the "what" and "why".]

## Architecture

### Current State Analysis

[If applicable, describe the existing system/approach and identify problems or limitations]

- **Issue 1**: Description of current limitation
- **Issue 2**: Description of performance/maintainability concern  
- **Issue 3**: Description of user experience gap

### Target Architecture

[Describe the new/improved architecture. Include diagrams if helpful]

```
[ASCII diagram or mermaid diagram showing component relationships]
```

### Design Principles

- **Principle 1**: Brief description of key design principle
- **Principle 2**: Another important architectural principle
- **Principle 3**: Third guiding principle

## Components and Interfaces

### Core Components

#### 1. [Primary Component Name]
```javascript
// Key interface or class structure
class ComponentName {
  constructor(config) {
    // Configuration approach
  }
  
  method1() {
    // Primary functionality
  }
}
```

#### 2. [Secondary Component Name]
```javascript
// Another key interface
interface ComponentInterface {
  property1: Type;
  property2: Type;
  method(): ReturnType;
}
```

### Integration Points

- **External System 1**: How this component integrates
- **External System 2**: Another integration approach
- **Internal System**: How it works with existing code

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: [Foundation Phase] (Week X)

**Goals:**
- Primary objective
- Secondary objective
- Compatibility objective

**Tasks:**
1. Implementation task 1
2. Implementation task 2
3. Validation task

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Risk and mitigation strategy
- Another risk and approach

### Phase 2: [Enhancement Phase] (Week X+1)

**Goals:**
- Advanced capability 1
- Advanced capability 2
- Polish and optimization

**Tasks:**
1. Enhancement task 1
2. Enhancement task 2
3. Testing and validation

### Phase 3: [Optional Future Phase] (Week X+2)

**Goals:**
- Future enhancement
- Extensibility preparation
- Performance optimization

## Technical Decisions

### [Decision 1]: Technology Choice

**Options Considered:**
- Option A: Pros and cons
- Option B: Pros and cons
- **Chosen**: Option C: Why this was selected

### [Decision 2]: Architecture Pattern

**Rationale:** Explanation of architectural choice and trade-offs

### [Decision 3]: Integration Approach  

**Rationale:** How this fits with existing systems
