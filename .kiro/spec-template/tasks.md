- [ ] 2. [Second foundational task]
  - [Task description with clear acceptance criteria]
  - [Implementation approach or key considerations]
  - _Requirements: [Requirement references]_
  - _Dependencies: #1_ [Reference to previous task if applicable]

- [ ] 3. [Third foundational task]
  - [Clear description of what needs to be implemented]
  - [Testing or validation requirements]
  - _Requirements: [Requirement references]_

- [ ] 4. [Fourth task completing foundation]

## Task Format Guidelines

### Task Structure
Each task should include:
- **Clear title** describing the deliverable
- **Detailed description** with 2-4 bullet points explaining what needs to be done
- **Requirements mapping** using `_Requirements: X.Y, Z.A_` format
- **Dependencies** using `_Dependencies: #N_` format for task references
- **Additional metadata** like `_Priority: high/medium/low_` or `_Effort: X hours_` when helpful

### Task Numbering
- Use sequential numbering within each phase
- Continue numbering across phases (don't restart at 1)
- Reference other tasks using #N format

### Requirements Traceability  
- Each task should map to specific requirements from requirements.md
- Use format: `_Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.2_` referencing requirement numbers
- Ensure all requirements are covered by at least one task

### Dependencies
- Use `_Dependencies: #N, #M_` to reference prerequisite tasks
- Only include direct dependencies, not transitive ones
- Dependencies should form a logical implementation order

## Success Criteria

This specification is complete when:
1. All tasks are marked as completed ([x])
2. All requirements from requirements.md are satisfied
3. Implementation matches the design described in design.md
4. All acceptance criteria are verifiable and have been validated
