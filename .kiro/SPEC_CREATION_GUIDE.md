# Kiro Specification Creation Guide

This guide codifies the structure and patterns from the earliest and most successful specifications in this project to ensure consistent, high-quality spec creation.

## What Is a Complete "Spec"?

A **specification** (or "spec") is complete if and only if it contains all three required components with proper structure. See `.kiro/SPEC_DEFINITION.md` for the complete definition and validation requirements.

**Required**: `requirements.md` + `design.md` + `tasks.md` (all properly structured)  
**Incomplete**: Missing any file, improper structure, or broken requirements traceability

## Quick Start

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp -r .kiro/spec-template .kiro/specs/your-new-spec-name
   ```

2. **Fill out in this order**:
   - `requirements.md` - Define what and why
   - `design.md` - Define how  
   - `tasks.md` - Define when and in what order

3. **Validate quality**:
   - Use `.kiro/spec-template/CHECKLIST.md` to verify completeness
   - Review against successful examples

## File Structure

Each spec requires exactly three files:

| File | Purpose | Key Elements |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **requirements.md** | What needs to be built and why | Introduction, User Stories, Acceptance Criteria |
| **design.md** | How it will be built | Architecture, Components, Implementation Strategy |
| **tasks.md** | Implementation breakdown | Phases, Numbered Tasks, Dependencies |

## Template Files

- **üìÅ `.kiro/spec-template/`** - Template files to copy for new specs
- **üìÑ `README.md`** - Detailed usage instructions and patterns
- **üìÑ `CHECKLIST.md`** - Quality validation checklist
- **üìÑ Templates**: `requirements.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`

## Key Patterns Identified

### Requirements Structure
- **Format**: User story ‚Üí Acceptance criteria (5-6 specific, testable criteria)
- **Language**: "WHEN X THEN system SHALL Y" with measurable criteria
- **Scope**: 3-9 requirements total (focused but complete)
- **Traceability**: Each requirement gets numbered for task mapping

### Design Approach  
- **Architecture-First**: Show components and relationships
- **Phased Implementation**: Break complex changes into 3 phases
- **Code Examples**: Include key interfaces/classes
- **Decision Documentation**: Explain choices and alternatives

### Task Organization
- **Phase Structure**: Foundation ‚Üí Core Implementation ‚Üí Integration/Polish
- **Requirements Mapping**: `_Requirements: 1.1, 2.3_` format
- **Dependencies**: `_Dependencies: #3, #5_` for proper ordering
- **Actionable**: Each task has clear deliverables and completion criteria

## Quality Standards

Based on analysis of successful specs:

‚úÖ **Good Specs Have**:
- Clear problem statement and user value
- Measurable acceptance criteria
- Phased implementation approach
- Complete requirements coverage
- Actionable tasks with dependencies

‚ùå **Avoid These Anti-Patterns**:
- Implementation details in requirements
- Vague acceptance criteria
- Monolithic (single phase) approach  
- Missing requirements traceability
- Tasks that can't be verified as complete

## Example References

Study these successful specs as examples:

- **`.kiro/specs/repository-improvement/`** - Complex, multi-phase spec
- **`.kiro/specs/code-quality-hook/`** - Focused technical implementation  
- **`.kiro/specs/typescript-migration/`** - Migration/refactoring approach
- **`.kiro/specs/markdown-library-integration/`** - Simple, well-scoped spec

## Validation Process

1. **Structure Check**: All three files present with required sections
2. **Quality Check**: Use checklist for requirements, design, and tasks
3. **Consistency Check**: Terminology and scope align across files
4. **Completeness Check**: All requirements covered by tasks

## Why This Structure Works

This three-file structure emerged from successful specs and provides:

- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: What vs How vs When
- **Requirements Traceability**: Tasks map back to specific requirements
- **Incremental Implementation**: Phases allow gradual delivery
- **Quality Validation**: Consistent format enables systematic review
- **Maintainability**: Structure supports updates as work progresses

The pattern scales from simple (3 tasks) to complex (47+ tasks) while maintaining clarity and actionability.
