# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an agent hook that automatically reviews code changes for common formatting and export mistakes before they are committed or saved. The hook will act as a quality gate to catch issues that even experienced developers might miss, ensuring consistent code quality across the project.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated hook that catches formatting mistakes in my code, so that I maintain professional code quality without manual review overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer saves a JavaScript/TypeScript file THEN the system SHALL validate proper ES module export syntax
2. WHEN a developer saves a file with inconsistent indentation THEN the system SHALL flag spacing and tab inconsistencies
3. WHEN a developer saves a file with missing semicolons THEN the system SHALL identify locations where semicolons are required
4. WHEN a developer saves a file with incorrect quote usage THEN the system SHALL flag inconsistent single/double quote usage
5. IF formatting violations are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific line numbers and suggested fixes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the hook to catch export/import mistakes, so that my modules work correctly without runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer exports a function or class THEN the system SHALL verify proper ES module export syntax
2. WHEN a developer imports from another module THEN the system SHALL validate import statement structure
3. WHEN a developer uses default exports THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency with import statements
4. IF export/import mismatches are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest correct syntax patterns
5. WHEN a developer saves a file with circular dependencies THEN the system SHALL warn about potential issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable quality levels for the hook, so that I can adjust strictness based on project requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the hook THEN the system SHALL offer strict, standard, and relaxed quality levels
2. WHEN using strict mode THEN the system SHALL enforce all formatting rules without exceptions
3. WHEN using standard mode THEN the system SHALL allow minor formatting variations but catch major issues
4. WHEN using relaxed mode THEN the system SHALL focus only on syntax errors and critical formatting problems
5. IF quality level is changed THEN the system SHALL update validation rules accordingly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the hook to integrate with existing development tools, so that it works seamlessly with my current workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hook runs THEN the system SHALL respect existing ESLint configurations
2. WHEN the hook detects issues THEN the system SHALL format output similar to ESLint for consistency
3. WHEN the hook runs THEN the system SHALL complete validation within 2 seconds for typical files
4. IF the hook fails THEN the system SHALL not block the save operation but SHALL log warnings
5. WHEN the hook runs THEN the system SHALL only validate files that have been modified

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the hook to provide actionable feedback, so that I can quickly fix identified issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific line and column numbers
2. WHEN export issues are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest correct syntax examples
3. WHEN the hook reports issues THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity (error, warning, info)
4. IF auto-fix is possible THEN the system SHALL offer to apply corrections automatically
5. WHEN multiple issues exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by impact on code functionality
