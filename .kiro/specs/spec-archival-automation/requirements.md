# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will automatically archive completed specs to maintain a clean and organized specs directory. When all tasks in a spec are marked as completed, the system will automatically move the spec to an archive directory, preserving the work while keeping the active specs directory focused on ongoing work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Kiro specs, I want completed specs to be automatically archived so that my active specs directory only shows work in progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all tasks in a spec's tasks.md file are marked as completed (using `[x]`) THEN the system SHALL automatically move the entire spec directory to an archive location
2. WHEN a spec is archived THEN the system SHALL preserve all spec files (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) in the archive
3. WHEN a spec is archived THEN the system SHALL create a timestamp record of when the archival occurred
4. WHEN a spec is archived THEN the system SHALL log the archival action for user visibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to access archived specs for reference so that I can review completed work when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN specs are archived THEN they SHALL be stored in a `.kiro/specs/archive/` directory
2. WHEN viewing archived specs THEN each archived spec SHALL maintain its original directory structure
3. WHEN accessing archived specs THEN they SHALL include an archive metadata file with completion date and original location
4. WHEN listing archived specs THEN the system SHALL provide a way to identify when each spec was completed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the archival process to be safe and reversible so that I can recover specs if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN archiving a spec THEN the system SHALL verify all tasks are truly completed before moving
2. WHEN archiving fails for any reason THEN the original spec SHALL remain in its current location unchanged
3. WHEN a spec is archived THEN the system SHALL create a backup record that allows restoration
4. IF archival is interrupted THEN the system SHALL not leave specs in a partial state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the archival system to integrate seamlessly with my workflow so that it doesn't interfere with active development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the archival system runs THEN it SHALL not interfere with active spec editing or task execution
2. WHEN checking for completed specs THEN the system SHALL only process specs that are not currently being modified
3. WHEN archival occurs THEN the system SHALL provide non-intrusive notification of the action
4. WHEN working with specs THEN the archival system SHALL run automatically without manual intervention

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure archival behavior so that I can control when and how specs are archived.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring archival THEN the system SHALL allow enabling or disabling automatic archival
2. WHEN configuring archival THEN the system SHALL allow setting a delay period before archival occurs
3. WHEN configuring archival THEN the system SHALL allow specifying custom archive locations
4. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for archival behavior
