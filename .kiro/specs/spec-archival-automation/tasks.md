  - Add tests for ConfigurationManager including config validation and migration
  - Implement tests for archive metadata generation and indexing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 3.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 12. Implement integration tests for end-to-end archival flow
  - Create integration tests that simulate complete spec archival process
  - Write tests for hook integration and automatic triggering
  - Add tests for concurrent archival operations and file locking
