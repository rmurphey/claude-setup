# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A general TODO tracking system that maintains a continuously updated list of tasks, issues, and improvements across the entire project. This system should automatically monitor and extract content from other spec files, integrate with existing workflows, capture issues from various sources, and provide a centralized view of all pending work items with proper prioritization and categorization. The tracker operates as a living document that reflects the current state of all project work.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized TODO list that automatically captures issues from linting, tests, and code analysis, so that I can see all pending work in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs code analysis THEN it SHALL automatically extract TODO comments from source code
2. WHEN linting errors are detected THEN the system SHALL categorize them by severity and add to the TODO list
3. WHEN test failures occur THEN the system SHALL capture failing test information and add remediation tasks
4. WHEN the TODO list is generated THEN it SHALL include file locations and line numbers for each item
5. WHEN duplicate items are detected THEN the system SHALL merge them to avoid redundancy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TODO items to be automatically prioritized and categorized, so that I can focus on the most important work first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TODO items are processed THEN the system SHALL assign priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
2. WHEN categorizing items THEN the system SHALL group by type (Bug, Enhancement, Refactor, Documentation, Test)
3. WHEN linting errors are processed THEN Critical and High severity SHALL be marked as high priority
4. WHEN test failures are detected THEN they SHALL be marked as Critical priority
5. WHEN TODO comments contain priority indicators THEN the system SHALL respect those priorities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TODO list to continuously monitor and extract content from all spec files, so that spec tasks are automatically tracked and cross-referenced.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN spec files are modified THEN the system SHALL automatically scan and extract incomplete tasks
2. WHEN tasks.md files are updated THEN the system SHALL sync task status and priorities to the TODO list
3. WHEN requirements.md files change THEN the system SHALL identify new requirements that need implementation
4. WHEN design.md files are updated THEN the system SHALL extract design decisions that require coding work
5. WHEN spec tasks are completed THEN the system SHALL automatically update the TODO list status
6. WHEN cross-spec dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL identify and track prerequisite relationships

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TODO list to integrate with any project workflow tool-agnostically, so that it works regardless of my chosen development tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any version control system THEN the system SHALL detect and integrate with it (Git, SVN, Mercurial)
2. WHEN using any linting tool THEN the system SHALL parse its output format (ESLint, Pylint, RuboCop, etc.)
3. WHEN using any test framework THEN the system SHALL extract failure information (Jest, pytest, Go test, etc.)
4. WHEN using any issue tracker THEN the system SHALL optionally integrate via plugins (GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear)
5. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL work without requiring specific vendor tools to be installed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manually add, edit, and complete TODO items, so that I can track custom work items alongside automated ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a manual TODO item THEN the system SHALL preserve it across automated updates
2. WHEN I mark an item as complete THEN the system SHALL move it to a completed section with timestamp
3. WHEN I edit an item THEN the system SHALL maintain the edit while preserving automated metadata
4. WHEN I assign an item to a category THEN the system SHALL respect that categorization
5. WHEN I set a due date or priority THEN the system SHALL use those values in sorting and display

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the TODO system to provide actionable reports and summaries, so that I can make informed decisions about development priorities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics by category and priority
2. WHEN displaying items THEN the system SHALL show estimated effort and complexity where available
3. WHEN items are related to specs THEN the system SHALL cross-reference spec tasks and requirements
4. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL support both markdown and CLI table formats
5. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL show completion trends and velocity metrics
