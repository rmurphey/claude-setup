# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a systematic enhancement of the claude-setup tool's code quality, architecture, and user experience. The implementation follows a three-phase approach focusing on foundation improvements, user experience enhancements, and advanced features. The goal is to transform the current monolithic CLI structure into a maintainable, extensible, and performant development tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: CLI Architecture Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the claude-setup tool, I want the CLI code split into focused modules, so that I can easily understand, test, and modify specific functionality without affecting other parts of the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI architecture is refactored THEN the bin/cli.js file SHALL be less than 50 lines
2. WHEN modules are created THEN each module SHALL be less than 150 lines
3. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain 90% or higher test coverage
4. WHEN modules are separated THEN each module SHALL have a single, well-defined responsibility
5. IF a user runs the CLI THEN the functionality SHALL remain identical to the current behavior

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to the claude-setup tool, I want comprehensive test coverage for all library modules, so that I can confidently make changes without introducing regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are implemented THEN the system SHALL achieve 85% or higher code coverage
2. WHEN language detection is tested THEN performance SHALL be verified to complete in under 100ms for typical projects
3. WHEN template generation is tested THEN all variable substitution edge cases SHALL be covered
4. WHEN tests run THEN unit tests SHALL complete in under 1 second total
5. IF integration tests are added THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds total

### Requirement 3: Error Handling Enhancement

**User Story:** As a user of the claude-setup tool, I want clear, actionable error messages when something goes wrong, so that I can quickly resolve issues without needing external help.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide specific error codes
2. WHEN an error is displayed THEN it SHALL include actionable suggestions for resolution
3. WHEN long-running operations execute THEN progress indicators SHALL be shown
4. WHEN errors are handled THEN they SHALL be categorized by type (language detection, file permissions, git issues)
5. IF error recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL suggest automatic recovery options

### Requirement 4: Documentation Optimization

**User Story:** As a new user evaluating the claude-setup tool, I want to quickly understand if it's right for my project and how to get started, so that I can make an informed decision within 30 seconds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the README THEN they SHALL find a 30-second decision section at the top
2. WHEN documentation is restructured THEN it SHALL include clear visual hierarchy
3. WHEN users need help THEN a separate GETTING_STARTED.md SHALL provide beginner guidance
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN a decision tree SHALL guide problem resolution
5. IF users have common questions THEN an FAQ section SHALL address them

### Requirement 5: Configuration System

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to standardize claude-setup configuration across my team's projects, so that all developers have consistent development environments and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is implemented THEN projects SHALL support .claude-setup.json files
2. WHEN configurations are loaded THEN they SHALL inherit from user → project → defaults
3. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN validation SHALL prevent setup errors
4. WHEN teams use configuration THEN they SHALL be able to create templates for common scenarios
5. IF configuration changes THEN migration SHALL be handled automatically

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer using claude-setup regularly, I want fast execution times, so that the tool doesn't slow down my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool runs repeatedly THEN execution SHALL be 50% faster than initial runs
2. WHEN the tool starts THEN startup time SHALL be under 2 seconds
3. WHEN heavy dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be loaded lazily
4. WHEN language detection runs THEN results SHALL be cached appropriately
5. IF file operations are performed THEN they SHALL use streaming for large files

### Requirement 7: Extended Language Support

**User Story:** As a developer working with TypeScript, C++, or C# projects, I want full claude-setup support for my language, so that I can use the same development workflow across all my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TypeScript projects are detected THEN full setup SHALL be provided
2. WHEN C++ projects are detected THEN appropriate tooling SHALL be configured
3. WHEN C# projects are detected THEN development environment SHALL be set up
4. WHEN new languages are added THEN they SHALL have feature parity with existing languages
5. IF language-specific templates are needed THEN they SHALL be provided

### Requirement 8: Template System Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer customizing claude-setup templates, I want conditional logic and template inheritance, so that I can create sophisticated, reusable template configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates use conditionals THEN they SHALL support if/else logic based on configuration
2. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL support inheritance from base templates
3. WHEN template syntax is used THEN it SHALL be validated for correctness
4. WHEN templates are composed THEN utilities SHALL help with complex compositions
5. IF template features are used THEN existing templates SHALL be updated to demonstrate capabilities

### Requirement 9: Plugin Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer with specific workflow needs, I want to extend claude-setup with custom plugins, so that I can adapt the tool to my unique requirements without modifying the core codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN plugins are developed THEN they SHALL follow a standardized interface
2. WHEN plugins are loaded THEN they SHALL be discovered and validated automatically
3. WHEN plugins execute THEN they SHALL run in a secure, sandboxed environment
4. WHEN plugin development is needed THEN comprehensive documentation SHALL be available
5. IF plugin management is required THEN CLI commands SHALL handle installation and configuration
