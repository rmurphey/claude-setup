# Recovery System Removal Specification

## Overview
Complete removal of all recovery system functionality from the Claude Setup codebase to eliminate broken promises, reduce complexity, and focus on core value proposition.

## Problem
The recovery system was designed as a major feature ("üè• Assess and recover existing codebase") but remains unimplemented. This creates user confusion, development overhead, and technical debt across 40+ files.

## Solution
Systematic removal of all recovery-related code, documentation, and tests while preserving all working functionality.

## Key Benefits
- **Honest user experience**: No broken promises or non-functional features
- **Reduced complexity**: Simpler CLI with fewer confusing options  
- **Development efficiency**: No maintenance overhead for unimplemented features
- **Clean codebase**: Elimination of dead code paths and unused types

## Scope of Removal
- **3 CLI flags**: `--fix`, `--dry-run`, `--auto-fix`
- **1 primary mode**: 'recovery' routing and handling
- **1 error class**: `RecoveryError` and related types
- **40+ files**: Documentation, help text, tests, and code references
- **300-500 lines**: Dead code and stub implementations

## Implementation Strategy
**Phase 1**: Core infrastructure removal (CLI flags, types, routing)  
**Phase 2**: Test suite cleanup (remove recovery-related tests)  
**Phase 3**: Documentation cleanup (README, help text, guides)  
**Phase 4**: Final validation (comprehensive testing and review)

## Timeline
**1.5 days total effort**
- Day 1: Core removal and test cleanup (6 hours)
- Day 2: Documentation and final validation (7 hours)

## Impact
**Code Quality**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase without dead code  
**User Experience**: Professional presentation with accurate feature descriptions  
**Development Velocity**: Faster iteration without recovery maintenance overhead

## Files
- `requirements.md` - Detailed functional requirements and acceptance criteria
- `design.md` - Technical removal strategy and component analysis  
- `tasks.md` - Phase-by-phase implementation roadmap with specific tasks

## Status
**Created**: Ready for implementation
**Priority**: High (prerequisite for other improvements)
**Effort**: 1.5 days
**Risk**: Low (removing non-functional code)
