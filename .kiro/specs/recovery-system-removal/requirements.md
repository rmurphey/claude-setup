# Recovery System Removal - Requirements

## Overview
Completely remove all recovery system functionality from the codebase to eliminate broken promises, reduce complexity, and focus on core value proposition.

## Problem Statement
The recovery system was designed as a major feature but remains unimplemented after significant development time. This creates several issues:
- **Broken promises**: Tool advertises "üè• Assess and recover existing codebase" but delivers error messages
- **User confusion**: CLI help and documentation describe functionality that doesn't work
- **Development overhead**: Maintaining stubs, error handling, and documentation for non-existent features
- **Technical debt**: Dead code paths, unused error types, and incomplete implementations
- **Complexity burden**: 40+ files contain recovery references that complicate maintenance

## Success Criteria
1. **Complete removal**: Zero references to recovery functionality in codebase
2. **Clean user experience**: No broken promises or non-functional features advertised
3. **Simplified CLI**: Reduced command surface area and clearer help documentation
4. **Maintained functionality**: All working features continue to operate correctly
5. **Clean test suite**: All tests pass without recovery-related assertions

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: CLI Interface Cleanup
- Remove all recovery-related command line flags (`--fix`, `--dry-run`, `--auto-fix`)
- Remove 'recovery' from primary mode types and routing logic
- Update help text to remove all recovery mode descriptions
- Remove recovery mode examples from CLI help output
- Simplify flag validation by removing recovery-specific combinations

### FR2: Code Architecture Simplification
- Remove `RecoveryError` class and related error handling
- Remove recovery-related methods from setup orchestrator
- Remove recovery command templates from generation system
- Clean up unused imports and dependencies
- Remove recovery-specific configuration options

### FR3: Documentation Cleanup
- Remove recovery mode descriptions from README.md
- Remove recovery value propositions from documentation
- Update architecture documentation to remove recovery components
- Clean up help text and examples in all documentation files
- Remove recovery-related sections from guides and tutorials

### FR4: Test Suite Cleanup
- Remove all recovery-related test cases
- Update integration tests to remove recovery mode testing
- Remove recovery flag parsing tests
- Update setup orchestrator tests to remove recovery method checks
- Ensure remaining tests continue to pass after removal

### FR5: Configuration Cleanup
- Remove recovery-related npm scripts from package.json
- Remove recovery error codes from error type definitions
- Remove recovery action properties from error classes
- Clean up internal documentation references

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Backward Compatibility
- Ensure no breaking changes to working functionality
- Maintain existing API contracts for non-recovery features
- Preserve existing command line interface for supported operations
- Ensure NPX execution continues to work correctly

### NFR2: Code Quality
- Maintain or improve test coverage percentage
- Remove all dead code and unused imports
- Ensure ESLint passes with no new violations
- Maintain TypeScript compilation without errors

### NFR3: User Experience
- Provide clear, honest feature descriptions
- Ensure CLI help is accurate and complete
- Remove confusing or misleading documentation
- Maintain professional presentation without false promises

### NFR4: Performance
- No performance degradation from cleanup
- Potentially improve CLI startup time by removing unused code paths
- Maintain fast NPX execution and setup workflow

## Technical Constraints
- Must not break existing setup, language detection, or configuration features
- Must maintain compatibility with existing .claude-setup.json files
- Must preserve all working CLI modes (setup, language-detection, configuration, etc.)
- Must maintain existing file generation and template systems

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Zero Recovery References**: No files contain recovery-related code, comments, or documentation
2. **CLI Simplification**: Help output contains no recovery mode information
3. **Documentation Accuracy**: All documentation accurately reflects available functionality
4. **Test Suite Health**: All tests pass with no recovery-related assertions
5. **Error Handling**: Clean error types without recovery-specific classes
6. **Code Cleanliness**: No unused imports, dead code, or orphaned files
7. **User Communication**: Clear messaging about what the tool does and doesn't do

## Out of Scope
- Implementing any recovery functionality (explicitly excluded)
- Adding new features to replace recovery capabilities
- Significant refactoring beyond removal requirements
- Changes to core setup or language detection logic
- Performance optimizations beyond dead code removal

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Accidentally removing working functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite validation, careful change review
- **Risk**: Breaking CLI contracts for existing users
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain all non-recovery command line interfaces
- **Risk**: User confusion about missing features
  - **Mitigation**: Clear, honest documentation about actual capabilities
- **Risk**: Technical debt in related systems
  - **Mitigation**: Clean up only recovery-specific code, avoid scope creep

## Dependencies
- Existing test suite must validate non-recovery functionality
- Documentation system for updating help text and guides
- ESLint and TypeScript compilation for code quality validation

## Success Metrics
- **Code reduction**: 40+ files cleaned of recovery references
- **CLI simplification**: 3 flags removed, help text reduced by ~30%
- **Documentation accuracy**: 100% of advertised features are functional
- **Test coverage**: Maintained or improved after cleanup
- **User experience**: No confusion about unavailable features
- **Development velocity**: Faster iteration without recovery maintenance overhead
