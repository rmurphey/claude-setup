# GitIgnore Audit System - Requirements

## Overview
Create an automated system to audit and fix .gitignore files for completeness, ensuring all generated files and common development artifacts are properly ignored.

## Problem Statement
Development projects often have incomplete .gitignore rules, leading to:
- Generated files being committed to version control
- Repository bloat from temporary artifacts
- Inconsistent ignore patterns across projects
- Missing coverage for common development tools and workflows

## Success Criteria
1. **Detection**: Identify missing .gitignore patterns for the project's technology stack
2. **Validation**: Verify existing patterns are correct and comprehensive
3. **Automation**: Provide automated fixes with user approval
4. **Integration**: Work seamlessly with existing project setup workflows
5. **Customization**: Allow project-specific overrides and additions

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Pattern Detection
- Analyze project files and detect technology stacks (JS/TS, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Swift)
- Identify build tools and frameworks in use (npm, cargo, maven, gradle, etc.)
- Detect development environments (VS Code, IntelliJ, Vim, etc.) from existing files
- Scan for CI/CD configurations that generate artifacts

### FR2: Rule Library
- Maintain comprehensive rule sets for each technology stack
- Include patterns for:
  - Build artifacts and compilation outputs
  - Package manager caches and lock files
  - Test coverage reports and temporary files
  - Editor and IDE configuration files
  - OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db, etc.)
  - Debug and log files
  - Temporary and backup files

### FR3: Audit Functionality
- Compare existing .gitignore against recommended patterns
- Identify missing critical patterns
- Flag potentially problematic or overly broad patterns
- Detect duplicate or redundant rules
- Validate pattern syntax and effectiveness

### FR4: Fix Generation
- Generate recommended additions to .gitignore
- Provide explanations for each suggested pattern
- Allow selective application of fixes
- Preserve existing comments and organization
- Suggest reorganization for better maintainability

### FR5: Integration Points
- Integrate with main project setup workflow
- Provide CLI command for standalone auditing
- Hook into pre-commit validation
- Support batch processing for multiple projects

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- Complete audit in <2 seconds for typical projects
- Handle projects with 10,000+ files efficiently
- Minimal memory footprint during scanning

### NFR2: Reliability
- 100% accuracy for detecting technology stacks
- No false positives for critical ignore patterns
- Graceful handling of unrecognized project types

### NFR3: Usability
- Clear, actionable recommendations
- Non-destructive by default (dry-run mode)
- Preserve user customizations and comments
- Intuitive CLI interface

### NFR4: Maintainability
- Extensible rule system for new technologies
- Version-controlled rule definitions
- Easy addition of custom project patterns

## Technical Constraints
- Must work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- No external dependencies beyond existing project stack
- Compatible with existing Claude Setup infrastructure
- Language-agnostic core with language-specific plugins

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Detects missing .gitignore patterns with 95%+ accuracy
2. Provides fixes for 20+ common technology stacks
3. Integrates with existing setup workflow seamlessly
4. Processes typical projects in under 2 seconds
5. Maintains existing .gitignore structure and comments
6. Provides clear rationale for each recommendation
7. Supports both interactive and automated modes

## Out of Scope
- Git repository scanning for already-committed files
- Automatic cleanup of files that should be ignored
- Complex glob pattern optimization
- Language-specific linting rule generation
- IDE plugin development

## Dependencies
- Existing language detection system
- File system scanning utilities
- Pattern matching and validation libraries
- CLI infrastructure from Claude Setup

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Overly aggressive patterns that ignore needed files
  - **Mitigation**: Conservative default patterns, user review required
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large repositories
  - **Mitigation**: Configurable scan depth, smart exclusions
- **Risk**: Technology detection failures
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to manual specification, comprehensive test coverage
