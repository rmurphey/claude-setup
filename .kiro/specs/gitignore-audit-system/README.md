# GitIgnore Audit System Specification

## Overview
This specification defines an automated system for auditing and fixing .gitignore files to ensure comprehensive coverage of generated files and development artifacts.

## Problem
The current manual approach to .gitignore maintenance has led to incomplete coverage, resulting in generated files being committed and repository bloat. A recent audit revealed missing patterns for NPM packages (*.tgz), debug logs, and editor files.

## Solution
An integrated audit system that:
- Automatically detects project technology stacks
- Compares against comprehensive rule libraries
- Provides interactive fixes with explanations
- Integrates seamlessly with project setup workflows

## Key Features
- **Smart Detection**: Identifies 20+ technologies and their build artifacts
- **Comprehensive Rules**: 200+ patterns across languages, editors, and tools
- **Safe Fixes**: Non-destructive with preview and selective application
- **CLI Integration**: Both standalone and workflow-integrated usage
- **Performance**: <2 second audits for typical projects

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Core infrastructure (scanner, rules, parser)
- **Week 2**: Audit engine and fix generation
- **Week 3**: CLI integration and UX
- **Week 4**: Testing and validation
- **Week 5**: Documentation and polish

## Impact
- Prevents accidental commits of generated files
- Reduces repository size and cleanup overhead  
- Standardizes .gitignore practices across projects
- Saves developer time through automation

## Files
- `requirements.md` - Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
- `design.md` - Technical architecture and component design
- `tasks.md` - Implementation roadmap with task breakdown

## Status
**Created**: Ready for implementation planning
**Priority**: Medium (improves development workflow quality)
**Effort**: 5 weeks (1 developer)
**Dependencies**: Existing language detection and CLI infrastructure
