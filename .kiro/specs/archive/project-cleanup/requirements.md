# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves cleaning up the project structure after the TypeScript migration to remove unnecessary JavaScript files, consolidate build outputs, and ensure a clean, maintainable project structure. The cleanup should preserve all functionality while removing redundant files and directories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unnecessary JavaScript files removed so that the project structure is clean and maintainable after TypeScript migration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the cleanup is complete THEN all redundant compiled JavaScript files SHALL be removed from the repository
2. WHEN the project is built THEN only the necessary compiled output SHALL remain in designated directories
3. WHEN developers work on the code THEN they SHALL only see TypeScript source files and necessary build artifacts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want the build process to work correctly after cleanup so that the project can be built and distributed properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN npm scripts are executed THEN the build process SHALL complete successfully
2. WHEN the project is compiled THEN TypeScript SHALL output to the correct directories
3. WHEN the package is tested THEN all tests SHALL pass after cleanup

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the CLI tool, I want the cleanup to be transparent so that the tool continues to work exactly as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI is executed via npx THEN it SHALL function identically after cleanup
2. WHEN CLI commands are run THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN the entry points SHALL remain functional

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear project structure so that I can easily understand what files are source code versus build artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project THEN source TypeScript files SHALL be clearly separated from compiled JavaScript
2. WHEN build artifacts are generated THEN they SHALL be in designated output directories only
3. WHEN the repository is cloned THEN unnecessary build artifacts SHALL not be included

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want the development workflow to remain functional so that I can continue developing and testing the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL execute successfully with the cleaned structure
2. WHEN linting is performed THEN it SHALL work correctly with the new structure
3. WHEN the project is built THEN all necessary files SHALL be available for distribution
