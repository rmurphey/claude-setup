# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the claude-setup tool from being Claude Code-specific to being tool-agnostic while maintaining support for Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and other AI development tools. The goal is to make the tool more inclusive and broadly useful while preserving all existing functionality for Claude Code users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using various AI tools (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Zed, Kiro, etc.), I want the setup tool to work with my preferred AI assistant, so that I can benefit from professional development infrastructure regardless of my AI tool choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool runs THEN it SHALL detect or ask about the user's preferred AI development tool
2. WHEN AI tool preference is selected THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate configuration files and templates
3. WHEN multiple AI tools are used THEN the system SHALL support hybrid configurations
4. WHEN no AI tool is specified THEN the system SHALL provide generic professional development setup
5. IF the user changes AI tool preference THEN the system SHALL migrate existing configurations appropriately

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer evaluating the tool, I want the branding and naming to be neutral, so that I don't feel excluded if I don't use Claude Code specifically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tool is named THEN it SHALL use a generic name like "AI Dev Setup" or "Professional Dev Setup"
2. WHEN documentation is displayed THEN it SHALL use inclusive language that mentions multiple AI tools
3. WHEN templates are generated THEN they SHALL use tool-agnostic variable names and content
4. WHEN CLI output is shown THEN it SHALL avoid Claude-specific terminology in general messages
5. IF tool-specific features are mentioned THEN they SHALL be clearly labeled as such

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Claude Code user, I want to maintain all existing functionality and workflows, so that my current development process is not disrupted by the tool-agnostic changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Claude Code is selected as the AI tool THEN all existing templates SHALL be generated identically
2. WHEN existing Claude Code projects are detected THEN the tool SHALL maintain backward compatibility
3. WHEN Claude-specific commands are used THEN they SHALL function exactly as before
4. WHEN Claude Code workflows are followed THEN no functionality SHALL be lost or degraded
5. IF Claude Code is the default choice THEN existing users SHALL experience no breaking changes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a GitHub Copilot user, I want templates and configurations optimized for my workflow, so that I can benefit from the same professional setup as Claude Code users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub Copilot is selected THEN appropriate VS Code settings SHALL be generated
2. WHEN Copilot templates are created THEN they SHALL include Copilot-specific best practices and guidelines
3. WHEN Copilot workflows are configured THEN they SHALL integrate with VS Code extensions and settings
4. WHEN Copilot documentation is generated THEN it SHALL include Copilot-specific collaboration patterns
5. IF Copilot and other tools are combined THEN the configuration SHALL support multiple tools simultaneously

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using other AI tools (Cursor, Zed, Kiro, Tabnine, etc.), I want basic support for my tool or generic AI-agnostic templates, so that I can still benefit from the professional development infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN other AI tools are specified THEN generic AI collaboration templates SHALL be provided
2. WHEN unsupported AI tools are mentioned THEN the system SHALL offer to create generic templates
3. WHEN no AI tool is selected THEN professional development setup SHALL proceed without AI-specific features
4. WHEN custom AI tool configurations are needed THEN the template system SHALL be extensible
5. IF new AI tools become popular THEN they SHALL be easy to add to the supported list

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want to configure the tool for my team's preferred AI tools, so that all team members get consistent setup regardless of individual preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN team configuration is set THEN it SHALL override individual AI tool preferences
2. WHEN multiple team members use the tool THEN they SHALL get identical AI tool configurations
3. WHEN team standards are defined THEN they SHALL be enforced across all generated templates
4. WHEN team configuration changes THEN existing projects SHALL be updatable to new standards
5. IF team uses multiple AI tools THEN the configuration SHALL support mixed environments

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer migrating between AI tools, I want to easily switch my project configuration, so that I can experiment with different tools without losing my professional development setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN switching AI tools THEN the system SHALL offer to migrate existing configurations
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN core development infrastructure SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN tool-specific files are changed THEN backups SHALL be created automatically
4. WHEN migration is complete THEN the new AI tool SHALL have full functionality
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL restore the previous configuration safely

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tool to maintain high-quality templates for each supported AI tool, so that I get the best possible experience regardless of my choice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are generated THEN they SHALL follow best practices for the selected AI tool
2. WHEN AI tool documentation is created THEN it SHALL include tool-specific workflows and patterns
3. WHEN commands are generated THEN they SHALL be optimized for the selected AI tool's capabilities
4. WHEN quality standards are applied THEN they SHALL be consistent across all AI tool options
5. IF new AI tool features are released THEN templates SHALL be updated to incorporate them
