# File Organization Cleanup - Requirements

## Overview
Reorganize the project's root directory structure to improve maintainability, follow conventions, and eliminate build artifacts that are in incorrect locations.

## Problem Statement
The project root directory contains several issues:
1. Files that belong in more appropriate subdirectories
2. A critical `lib/lib/` duplication indicating build configuration problems
3. Empty test directories and temporary files
4. Inconsistent organization that makes the project harder to navigate

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Fix Build Configuration Issues
- **FR1.1**: Resolve the `lib/lib/` nested directory structure
- **FR1.2**: Ensure TypeScript compilation outputs to correct locations
- **FR1.3**: Verify all compiled artifacts are in expected locations

### FR2: Relocate Misplaced Files
- **FR2.1**: Move `kiro-hook-executor.js` to `.kiro/` directory (kiro-specific infrastructure)
- **FR2.2**: Move `VALUE_PROPOSITION.md` to `docs/` directory (project documentation)
- **FR2.3**: Move `test-integration.js` to `__tests__/` directory (test file)

### FR3: Remove Unnecessary Files
- **FR3.1**: Delete `current-js-files.txt` (temporary file listing)
- **FR3.2**: Remove empty test directories (`test-empty-dir/`, `test-npx/`)
- **FR3.3**: Clean up temporary coverage files in `coverage/tmp/`

### FR4: Update References
- **FR4.1**: Update any package.json scripts referencing moved files
- **FR4.2**: Update documentation links to moved files
- **FR4.3**: Update any imports or paths in code that reference moved files

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Zero Breaking Changes
- All functionality must continue to work after reorganization
- No API changes or breaking modifications to public interfaces
- All tests must continue to pass

### NFR2: Maintainability
- Improved project structure should make navigation easier
- Files should be in logical, expected locations
- Build output should follow standard conventions

### NFR3: Atomicity
- Changes should be made in logical phases to enable rollback if needed
- Each phase should be tested before proceeding to the next

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Criteria
1. `lib/lib/` duplication is eliminated and build outputs correctly
2. All misplaced files are moved to appropriate directories
3. All unnecessary files and directories are removed
4. All tests pass and functionality remains intact

### Secondary Success Criteria
1. Project root directory is cleaner and more navigable
2. File organization follows standard conventions
3. Documentation and references are updated to reflect new locations

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with existing CI/CD processes
- Cannot break NPX package execution
- Must preserve git history for moved files

### Process Constraints
- Changes must be committed in logical chunks
- Each phase must be tested before proceeding
- Must follow existing project conventions for file organization

## Dependencies
- Understanding of TypeScript build configuration
- Knowledge of file references in package.json and documentation
- Access to test all functionality after moves

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Breaking File References
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive search for file references before moving
- **Mitigation**: Test functionality after each critical move

### Risk 2: Build Configuration Issues
- **Mitigation**: Understand current build process before modifying
- **Mitigation**: Verify build outputs after configuration changes

### Risk 3: Hook System Disruption
- **Mitigation**: Test kiro hook system after moving kiro-hook-executor.js
- **Mitigation**: Update any hardcoded paths in hook configuration
