# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create test utility functions and behavioral testing helpers
  - Implement configuration test data factories for creating valid and invalid test configurations
  - Create behavioral assertion helpers that focus on outcomes rather than structure
  - Build mock strategies for external dependencies that support behavioral testing
  - Develop test utilities for common patterns like validation result checking
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1, 6.1_

- [ ] 2. Refactor cli-interactive.test.js to eliminate property assertions
  - Replace direct property assertions like `interactive.modeQuestion.type` with behavioral tests
  - Convert array index dependencies to functional validation testing
  - Transform validation array checks into actual validation behavior testing
  - Ensure configuration validation tests focus on validation outcomes rather than internal arrays
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 3.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 3. Refactor setup-orchestrator.test.js to eliminate method existence checks
  - Replace `typeof method === 'function'` assertions with actual method behavior testing
  - Convert template generation tests to validate template content rather than method existence
  - Transform configuration object tests to verify functional outcomes
  - Ensure DevContainer config tests validate generated configuration behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 3.2, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Refactor language-config.test.js to eliminate structure dependencies
  - Replace nested property assertions like `config.language.primary` with behavioral validation
  - Convert detection result structure tests to outcome-based assertions
  - Transform configuration loading tests to verify functional behavior
  - Ensure language detection tests validate detection outcomes rather than internal structure
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3, 3.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 5. Refactor code-quality-hook.test.js to use behavioral patterns
  - Convert quality level manager tests to validate actual quality management behavior
  - Replace file content assertions with functional outcome validation
  - Transform ESLint integration tests to verify linting behavior rather than output structure
  - Ensure hook execution tests validate hook outcomes rather than internal processes
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4, 4.3, 6.2_

- [ ] 6. Update remaining test files to follow behavioral testing patterns
  - Scan all remaining test files for structural assertion antipatterns
  - Convert any remaining property assertions to behavioral validations
  - Transform method existence checks to actual method behavior testing
  - Ensure all tests focus on public interface behavior rather than implementation details
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 5.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive test coverage validation
  - Verify that behavioral tests maintain or improve coverage compared to structural tests
  - Ensure all critical functionality is covered by behavior-focused tests
  - Validate that refactored tests catch actual functional regressions
  - Confirm that tests pass with current implementation after refactoring
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.4, 5.1, 6.4_

- [ ] 8. Create test documentation and guidelines
  - Document behavioral testing patterns and best practices for the codebase
  - Create examples of good vs bad testing patterns for future contributors
  - Establish code review checklist for preventing test antipatterns
  - Provide guidelines for writing maintainable, behavior-focused tests
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.1, 6.1, 6.4_

- [ ] 9. Validate test stability and maintainability
  - Run full test suite to ensure all refactored tests pass
  - Verify that tests remain stable when implementation details change
  - Confirm that test failure messages provide meaningful feedback about functional issues
  - Ensure that tests can be maintained without frequent updates during refactoring
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.1, 5.1, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Establish continuous integration for test quality
  - Add linting rules or checks to prevent future test antipatterns
  - Create automated validation for behavioral testing patterns
  - Implement test quality metrics to monitor test maintainability
  - Ensure new tests follow established behavioral testing guidelines
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.3_
