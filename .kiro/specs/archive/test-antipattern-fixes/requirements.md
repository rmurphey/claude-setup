# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring the existing test suite to eliminate antipatterns that create brittle tests dependent on implementation details. The current tests assert on object properties, internal structure, and method existence rather than testing actual behavior and functionality. This refactoring will create more robust tests that focus on outcomes and public interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that focus on behavior rather than implementation details so that refactoring doesn't break tests unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL test what methods do rather than asserting method existence
2. WHEN object structures change THEN tests SHALL continue to pass if behavior is preserved
3. WHEN internal properties are refactored THEN tests SHALL not break due to property name changes
4. WHEN implementation details change THEN tests SHALL remain valid if public interfaces are maintained

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want tests that validate functional outcomes so that I can confidently refactor code without fear of breaking working functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration validation is tested THEN tests SHALL verify validation results rather than internal validation arrays
2. WHEN setup processes are tested THEN tests SHALL verify setup outcomes rather than method signatures
3. WHEN error handling is tested THEN tests SHALL verify error behavior rather than error object properties
4. WHEN data processing is tested THEN tests SHALL verify processed results rather than intermediate data structures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a contributor, I want tests that are maintainable and don't require updates when implementation details change so that I can focus on feature development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests assert on data THEN they SHALL use functional assertions rather than structural property checks
2. WHEN tests verify object behavior THEN they SHALL test public methods rather than private properties
3. WHEN tests check configurations THEN they SHALL verify configuration effects rather than configuration structure
4. WHEN tests validate arrays THEN they SHALL test array behavior rather than specific indices or lengths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests that provide meaningful feedback about actual functionality failures so that debugging is more effective.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests fail THEN failure messages SHALL indicate functional problems rather than structural mismatches
2. WHEN assertions are made THEN they SHALL relate to user-facing behavior rather than internal implementation
3. WHEN test data is used THEN it SHALL represent realistic usage scenarios rather than implementation artifacts
4. WHEN mocking is employed THEN it SHALL mock external dependencies rather than internal object properties

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want tests that remain stable during refactoring so that test results accurately reflect system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is refactored THEN tests SHALL continue to pass if functionality is preserved
2. WHEN internal APIs change THEN tests SHALL not require updates unless public behavior changes
3. WHEN object structures evolve THEN tests SHALL remain valid if the same outcomes are achieved
4. WHEN method implementations change THEN tests SHALL continue to validate the same behavioral contracts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want consistent testing patterns across the codebase so that all contributors can write and maintain tests effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new tests are written THEN they SHALL follow behavior-focused testing patterns
2. WHEN existing tests are updated THEN they SHALL be converted to use functional assertions
3. WHEN test utilities are created THEN they SHALL support behavior testing rather than structure testing
4. WHEN test documentation is provided THEN it SHALL emphasize testing outcomes over implementation details
