# Markdown Library Integration - Design Document

## Current Implementation

The markdown integration is essentially complete. The implementation now uses:

### MarkdownSpecScanner (.kiro/lib/markdown-spec-scanner.js)
- Uses unified/remark for AST-based parsing
- Handles basic task extraction with fallback compatibility
- Integrated with remarkKiroTasks plugin for enhanced processing

### remarkKiroTasks Plugin (.kiro/lib/remark-kiro-tasks.js)  
- Custom remark plugin for Kiro-specific task patterns
- Handles hierarchical task structures
- Extracts metadata from _Pattern:_ syntax
- Validates task format and numbering

### Integration Layer (src/lib/kiro-spec-scanner.ts)
- Bridges new AST implementation with existing APIs
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Converts enhanced AST tasks to KiroTask format

## Remaining Work

Only 3 simple tasks remain:

1. **Verify metadata extraction** - Ensure _Requirements:_, _Dependencies:_, _Priority:_ patterns work
2. **Test edge cases** - Verify malformed syntax doesn't break the parser  
3. **Compatibility check** - Confirm all existing .kiro/specs files parse correctly

## Architecture Decision

**Chosen:** Remark with unified processor
- Mature, well-maintained library
- Strong TypeScript support
- Flexible plugin system
- Good performance characteristics

The implementation is working well and doesn't need the complex features originally planned (performance benchmarks, fallback mechanisms, plugin architecture, etc.).
