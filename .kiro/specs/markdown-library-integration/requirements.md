# Markdown Library Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current AST-based markdown parsing using remark is working well. This spec focuses on completing the integration and ensuring it meets the basic needs for parsing `.kiro/specs` task files.

## Current State

Based on git history, Phase 1 and Phase 2 are complete:
- Remark library is integrated and functional
- AST-based task parsing works via remarkKiroTasks plugin
- All existing tests pass
- Basic metadata extraction is implemented

## Remaining Requirements

### FR1: Complete Current Integration
- **FR1.1**: Ensure robust metadata extraction from _Pattern:_ syntax
- **FR1.2**: Handle edge cases in task parsing gracefully
- **FR1.3**: Maintain compatibility with existing spec files

## Success Criteria

The markdown integration is considered complete when:
1. All existing functionality works reliably
2. Metadata patterns (_Requirements:_, _Dependencies:_, _Priority:_) are parsed correctly
3. No regressions in existing spec file processing

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT needed:
- Performance benchmarking (current performance is adequate)
- Fallback mechanisms (AST parsing works fine)
- Plugin architecture (current setup handles our use cases)
- YAML frontmatter parsing (specs don't use it)
- Complex validation systems (existing validation is sufficient)
- Migration utilities (migration is already done)
- Advanced querying capabilities (not needed)
- Multiple checkbox format support (standard format works)
