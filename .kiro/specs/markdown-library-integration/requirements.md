# Markdown Library Integration - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Replace the current fragile regex-based markdown parsing in `kiro-spec-scanner.ts` with a robust markdown library to enable better spec file reading, validation, and extensibility.

## Background

The existing spec scanner uses manual regex parsing with several limitations:
- Fragile task detection patterns
- No understanding of markdown structure
- Limited metadata extraction capabilities
- Manual parsing prone to edge case failures
- Difficult to extend for new features

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Enhanced Markdown Parsing
- **FR1.1**: Replace regex-based parsing with AST-based markdown processing
- **FR1.2**: Properly handle markdown structure (headers, sections, lists, nested content)
- **FR1.3**: Support GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features
- **FR1.4**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing spec formats

### FR2: Improved Task Detection
- **FR2.1**: Recognize hierarchical task structures (phases → tasks → subtasks)
- **FR2.2**: Support multiple checkbox syntaxes automatically
- **FR2.3**: Extract task metadata from custom syntax patterns
- **FR2.4**: Handle task relationships and dependencies

### FR3: Rich Metadata Support
- **FR3.1**: Parse YAML frontmatter in spec files
- **FR3.2**: Support custom metadata blocks and comments
- **FR3.3**: Extract structured metadata from task descriptions
- **FR3.4**: Validate metadata against schemas

### FR4: Structural Validation
- **FR4.1**: Verify spec files follow required templates
- **FR4.2**: Detect missing required sections
- **FR4.3**: Validate task numbering sequences
- **FR4.4**: Check for orphaned references and broken dependencies


## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
- **NFR1.1**: Parsing performance should be equal or better than current implementation
- **NFR1.2**: Memory usage should remain reasonable for large spec files
- **NFR1.3**: Support incremental parsing for real-time editing

### NFR2: Maintainability
- **NFR2.1**: Clear separation between parsing logic and business logic
- **NFR2.2**: Plugin architecture for custom extensions
- **NFR2.3**: Comprehensive test coverage for parsing edge cases
- **NFR2.4**: Clear error messages for parsing failures

### NFR3: Extensibility
- **NFR3.1**: Support for custom markdown extensions
- **NFR3.2**: Plugin system for new task types and metadata
- **NFR3.3**: Integration points for external systems
- **NFR3.4**: Future-ready for AI integration features

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: Library Selection
- **TR1.1**: Choose mature, well-maintained markdown library
- **TR1.2**: TypeScript support with proper type definitions
- **TR1.3**: AST-based processing capabilities
- **TR1.4**: Plugin/extension ecosystem

### TR2: API Compatibility
- **TR2.1**: Maintain existing public API surface
- **TR2.2**: Gradual migration path for internal implementation
- **TR2.3**: Backward compatibility with legacy spec formats
- **TR2.4**: Migration utilities for spec format updates

### TR3: Integration
- **TR3.1**: Integrate with existing TypeScript build process
- **TR3.2**: Work with current testing framework
- **TR3.3**: Compatible with existing ESLint configuration
- **TR3.4**: No breaking changes to dependent modules

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Parsing Accuracy**: 100% compatibility with existing spec files
2. **Performance**: No regression in parsing speed
3. **Test Coverage**: Maintain >95% test coverage
4. **Error Reduction**: Eliminate regex-related parsing failures

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability scores
2. **Feature Enablement**: Support for advanced metadata patterns
3. **Validation**: Comprehensive spec file validation
4. **Developer Experience**: Easier debugging and error messages

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work with Node.js 16+
- TypeScript compilation to ES modules
- No breaking changes to public APIs
- Existing test suite must continue to pass

### Resource Constraints
- Implementation should reuse existing test infrastructure
- Migration should be incremental to minimize risk
- Documentation updates should be minimal

### Business Constraints
- No disruption to current workflow
- Backward compatibility with archived specs
- Maintain current performance characteristics

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Current `kiro-spec-scanner.ts` implementation
- Existing test suite in `spec-scanner.test.js`
- TypeScript compilation pipeline
- ESLint configuration

### External Dependencies
- Markdown parsing library (to be selected)
- Associated type definitions
- Any required plugins or extensions
