# Markdown Library Integration - Tasks

## Current State Assessment

Phase 1 and Phase 2 are complete:
- [x] Remark library integrated successfully
- [x] AST-based parsing implemented via MarkdownSpecScanner
- [x] remarkKiroTasks plugin handles task detection
- [x] All existing tests pass (298/298)
- [x] Basic metadata extraction works

## Remaining Tasks

### Task 1: Verify Metadata Extraction
- [ ] 1. Test metadata patterns (_Requirements:_, _Dependencies:_, _Priority:_) work correctly
  _Priority: high_
  _Effort: 1 hour_

### Task 2: Handle Edge Cases  
- [ ] 2. Ensure graceful handling of malformed task syntax
  _Priority: medium_ 
  _Effort: 1 hour_

### Task 3: Final Integration Check
- [ ] 3. Verify compatibility with all existing .kiro/specs files
  _Priority: high_
  _Effort: 1 hour_

## Completion Criteria

This spec is complete when:
1. Metadata extraction works reliably for all existing patterns
2. Edge cases don't break the parser
3. All existing spec files parse correctly

## Explicitly Out of Scope

These tasks are NOT needed and should be removed:
- ~~Performance benchmarking~~ (current performance is fine)
- ~~Fallback mechanisms~~ (AST parsing is reliable)
- ~~YAML frontmatter~~ (specs don't use this)
- ~~Plugin architecture~~ (current setup works)
- ~~Migration utilities~~ (migration is done)
- ~~Complex validation~~ (existing validation sufficient)
- ~~Advanced querying~~ (not needed)
- ~~Multiple checkbox formats~~ (standard format works)
