# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The `/todo` command redesign integrates with the Kiro spec format to provide intelligent task management that automatically extracts, tracks, and manages tasks from Kiro spec files. This system transforms the current basic TODO functionality into a comprehensive task management system that understands spec structure, maintains task relationships, and provides actionable insights for project development within the Kiro specification framework.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `/todo` command to automatically extract tasks from all Kiro spec files, so that I have a centralized view of all spec-defined work items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the `/todo` command runs THEN it SHALL scan all `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md` files for task items
2. WHEN parsing tasks.md files THEN it SHALL extract task status, descriptions, and requirement references
3. WHEN task dependencies exist THEN the system SHALL identify and track prerequisite relationships
4. WHEN spec files are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the task list automatically
5. WHEN displaying tasks THEN it SHALL include spec name, task status, and requirement mappings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `/todo` command to understand Kiro spec structure and relationships, so that I can see how tasks connect across different specs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing specs THEN the system SHALL link tasks.md items to their corresponding requirements.md entries
2. WHEN dependencies exist between specs THEN the system SHALL identify cross-spec task relationships
3. WHEN a spec has design decisions THEN the system SHALL extract actionable implementation tasks
4. WHEN displaying relationships THEN the system SHALL show task hierarchy and dependencies visually

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add new TODO items using the `/todo` command, so that I can capture tasks that aren't part of existing specs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `/todo add <description>` THEN the system SHALL create a new TODO item with the provided description
2. WHEN adding a TODO THEN the system SHALL allow specification of priority, category, and target spec
3. WHEN creating TODOs without a target spec THEN the system SHALL place them in a general project TODO list
4. WHEN adding TODOs with spec context THEN the system SHALL suggest appropriate task placement in spec files
5. WHEN TODOs are created THEN the system SHALL assign unique identifiers for future reference

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update task status directly through the `/todo` command, so that I can manage spec tasks without manually editing files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN marking a task complete THEN the system SHALL update the corresponding tasks.md file automatically
2. WHEN updating task status THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing task metadata and formatting
3. WHEN adding task notes THEN the system SHALL append them to the task description with timestamps
4. WHEN task priority changes THEN the system SHALL update both the TODO display and source file
5. WHEN tasks are modified THEN the system SHALL maintain spec file integrity and markdown formatting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `/todo` command to provide actionable insights and progress tracking, so that I can make informed decisions about spec implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL show progress percentages by spec and overall
2. WHEN displaying tasks THEN the system SHALL estimate effort based on task complexity and requirements
3. WHEN identifying blockers THEN the system SHALL highlight tasks waiting on dependencies
4. WHEN showing priorities THEN the system SHALL surface critical path tasks for each spec
5. WHEN tracking velocity THEN the system SHALL provide completion trend analysis across specs

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `/todo` command to support both interactive and batch operations, so that I can work efficiently in different development contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `/todo` without arguments THEN it SHALL display an interactive task browser
2. WHEN using `/todo list` THEN it SHALL show a formatted task list with filtering options
3. WHEN using `/todo complete <task-id>` THEN it SHALL mark the specified task as complete
4. WHEN using `/todo status <spec>` THEN it SHALL show progress for a specific spec
5. WHEN using `/todo sync` THEN it SHALL refresh all task data from spec files

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the `/todo` command to integrate with existing project workflows, so that it works seamlessly with current development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pre-commit hooks run THEN the system SHALL verify that completed tasks are properly marked in spec files
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL output in formats compatible with existing documentation workflows
3. WHEN task status changes THEN the system SHALL optionally integrate with external issue trackers
4. WHEN specs are archived THEN the system SHALL handle task transitions gracefully
5. WHEN working with incomplete specs THEN the system SHALL identify missing requirements or design elements
