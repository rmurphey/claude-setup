# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Establish baseline and create safety checkpoint
  - Run comprehensive test suite to establish working baseline
  - Create git commit as rollback point before any cleanup operations
  - Document current project structure and file counts
  - Verify TypeScript compilation and CLI functionality work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Analyze and categorize files for cleanup
  - Identify all JavaScript files that have TypeScript equivalents in src/
  - Categorize files as safe-to-remove, verify-first, or keep
  - Create detailed cleanup plan with file-by-file analysis
  - Verify no source files will be accidentally removed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Remove obviously redundant build artifacts
  - Delete dist-test/ directory (temporary test compilation artifacts)
  - Remove tsconfig.tsbuildinfo (will be regenerated)
  - Clean up any temporary coverage files in non-standard locations
  - Verify build process still works after artifact removal
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [x] 4. Update TypeScript configuration for clean build output
  - Modify tsconfig.json to output compiled JavaScript to lib/ directory
  - Update build scripts in package.json to use clean build process
  - Add clean script to remove build artifacts before compilation
  - Test TypeScript compilation with new configuration
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Remove redundant compiled JavaScript files
  - Remove old lib/ directory contents (compiled from previous build system)
  - Delete JavaScript files that have corresponding TypeScript sources
  - Preserve essential JavaScript files (CLI entry points, configuration)
  - Verify no source files are accidentally removed
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 4.1_

- [x] 6. Update package.json for clean distribution
  - Update main entry point to reference new lib/ output location
  - Update files array to include only necessary distribution files
  - Remove references to old build output locations
  - Verify package.json configuration is correct for NPM distribution
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.2, 4.2_

- [x] 7. Validate build process and functionality
  - Run clean build from TypeScript source to new lib/ output
  - Execute complete test suite to verify all functionality preserved
  - Test CLI commands to ensure they work with new build output
  - Verify NPX installation and execution work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 8. Clean up remaining unnecessary files
  - Remove any remaining redundant JavaScript files
  - Clean up empty directories left after file removal
  - Remove any temporary files or build artifacts
  - Verify git status shows only intended changes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 9. Final validation and testing
  - Run comprehensive test suite to ensure all tests pass
  - Test all CLI functionality to verify complete preservation
  - Validate NPM package structure and contents
  - Test development workflow (build, test, lint) end-to-end
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.1, 3.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 10. Update documentation and finalize cleanup
  - Update any documentation that references old file locations
  - Clean up any remaining temporary or unnecessary files
  - Verify project structure matches intended clean architecture
  - Confirm all requirements are met and functionality preserved
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1, 4.3_
