Use the archival system's safety checks to only archive specs that haven't been recently modified\n4. Archive any eligible specs using the existing ArchivalEngine.archiveSpec() method\n5. Provide a brief, non-intrusive summary of any archival actions taken\n\nImportant: Use the existing, tested archival system components. Don't implement archival logic manually. The system should handle all safety checks and error handling automatically."
