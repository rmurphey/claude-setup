## Return on Investment

### Time Savings Calculation
- **Setup time eliminated**: 2-4 hours per project
- **Quality issue prevention**: 1-2 hours per project (debugging, fixes)
- **Documentation efficiency**: 0.5-1 hour per project
- **Recovery/maintenance**: 1-3 hours saved per project over lifetime

### Frequency Multipliers
- **1 project/month**: 54 hours/year saved
- **2 projects/month**: 108 hours/year saved
- **1 project/week**: 216 hours/year saved

### Cost Avoidance
- **Technical debt prevention**: Harder to quantify but significant
- **Bug reduction**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues early
- **Onboarding efficiency**: New team members productive faster
- **Client satisfaction**: Professional delivery reduces revision cycles
