## Session Metrics

| Date | Commits | Files Changed | Token Savings | Commands Added |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| 2025-08-16 | 13 | 30+ | 87-91% | 2 new, 4 consolidated |

### Command Consolidation Results
- `hygiene`: 264 → 30 lines (89% reduction)
- `commit`: 296 → 33 lines (89% reduction)  
- `todo`: 305 → 43 lines (86% reduction)
- `maintainability`: 458 → 42 lines (91% reduction)

## Session Retrospective (2025-08-16)

### What Went Well
1. **Repository Transformation**: Successfully converted from template to living reference
2. **Token Efficiency Achievement**: 87-91% reduction validated across all commands
3. **Documentation Created**: 2,500+ lines of comprehensive docs with citations
4. **Pattern Discovery**: Identified and documented reusable Claude patterns
5. **Command Architecture**: Subdirectory organization proved scalable

### Key Learnings Documented
- Created `LEARNINGS.md` capturing session insights and anti-patterns
- Created `docs/CLAUDE_PATTERNS.md` with 15+ discovered patterns
- Updated `BEST_PRACTICES.md` with production session lessons
- Added `/retrospective` command for future session analysis

### Metrics Summary
- **Duration**: ~2.5 hours
- **Commits**: 16 (all atomic, <500 lines)
- **Token Savings**: 87-91% across 4 commands
- **New Documentation**: 3 major docs created
- **Commands Added**: 3 new (`tdd`, `context-manage`, `retrospective`)

### Next Session Priorities
1. Test all npm scripts systematically
2. Create automated testing suite
3. Build metrics dashboard
4. Add framework-specific commands
5. Set up GitHub Actions

## Learnings Captured This Session

### Architecture Decisions
- **Living reference > template repository**: Repository should use its own commands
- **Subdirectories work**: `.claude/commands/detailed/` provides clean organization
- **NPM delegation wins**: 87-91% token reduction through script delegation
- **Minimal by default**: Token-efficient commands as primary, verbose as fallback

### Development Practices
- **Atomic commits essential**: 1-3 files per commit, each creating working functionality
- **Always work from root**: Avoid getting lost in subdirectories
- **Self-documentation works**: Commands can update their own documentation
- **Track everything**: Metrics enable continuous improvement

### Mistakes and Solutions
- **Problem**: Got lost in subdirectories during file operations
- **Solution**: Always return to repo root after operations
- **Learning**: Add root directory discipline to best practices


## Quality Status
- **Lint**: ❌ Issues found (need to fix)
- **Tests**: ⚠️ No tests configured yet
- **Build**: ✅ No build required (documentation/templates)
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive with citations
- **Token Efficiency**: ✅ 87-91% reduction achieved

## Repository Stats
- **Total Commands**: 31 (27 root + 4 detailed)
- **Documentation Files**: 11
- **Token Savings**: 87-91% average
- **Best Practices Documented**: 10 major sections
- **Citations**: 28+ authoritative sources
