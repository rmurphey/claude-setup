# Active Work - Claude Setup Repository

## Repository Transformation ✅ (2025-01-16)
- [x] Move commands from templates/ to .claude/commands/
- [x] Update README and package.json for v2.0.0 living reference
- [x] Create comprehensive BEST_PRACTICES.md with 28+ citations
- [x] Create SELF_UPDATING.md for self-documentation system
- [x] Enhance /docs command with self-updating capabilities
- [x] Create token-efficient minimal commands (87-91% reduction)
- [x] Organize detailed versions in .claude/commands/detailed/
- [x] Add new production commands (tdd, context-manage)
- [x] Implement self-documenting metrics tracking
- [x] Create npm scripts for token efficiency

## Current Focus
- [ ] Create command testing suite
- [ ] Add more production commands (ai-review, security-scan, breaking-change)
- [ ] Create framework-specific command sets (React, Python, Go, Rust)
- [ ] Build metrics dashboard visualization
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for documentation validation
- [ ] Create installation script for easy setup

## Session Metrics

| Date | Commits | Files Changed | Token Savings | Commands Added |
|------|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| 2025-01-16 | 13 | 30+ | 87-91% | 2 new, 4 consolidated |

### Command Consolidation Results
- `hygiene`: 264 → 30 lines (89% reduction)
- `commit`: 296 → 33 lines (89% reduction)  
- `todo`: 305 → 43 lines (86% reduction)
- `maintainability`: 458 → 42 lines (91% reduction)

## Learnings Captured This Session

### Architecture Decisions
- **Living reference > template repository**: Repository should use its own commands
- **Subdirectories work**: `.claude/commands/detailed/` provides clean organization
- **NPM delegation wins**: 87-91% token reduction through script delegation
- **Minimal by default**: Token-efficient commands as primary, verbose as fallback

### Development Practices
- **Atomic commits essential**: 1-3 files per commit, each creating working functionality
- **Always work from root**: Avoid getting lost in subdirectories
- **Self-documentation works**: Commands can update their own documentation
- **Track everything**: Metrics enable continuous improvement

### Mistakes and Solutions
- **Problem**: Got lost in subdirectories during file operations
- **Solution**: Always return to repo root after operations
- **Learning**: Add root directory discipline to best practices

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for all commands
   - [ ] Validate all npm scripts work correctly
   - [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility

2. **Documentation Completion**
   - [ ] Create MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for template → living reference
   - [ ] Create COMMAND_DEVELOPMENT.md for creating new commands
   - [ ] Update all command examples with real usage

3. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Implement /ai-review command for automated PR reviews
   - [ ] Create /security-scan for vulnerability detection
   - [ ] Add /breaking-change for conventional commits

4. **Distribution**
   - [ ] Publish as npm package
   - [ ] Create one-line installation script
   - [ ] Set up GitHub template repository

## Deferred Items
- Multi-language command sets (beyond JS/TS)
- Visual metrics dashboard
- VS Code extension integration
- Team collaboration features

## Quality Status
- **Lint**: ❌ Issues found (need to fix)
- **Tests**: ⚠️ No tests configured yet
- **Build**: ✅ No build required (documentation/templates)
- **Documentation**: ✅ Comprehensive with citations
- **Token Efficiency**: ✅ 87-91% reduction achieved

## Repository Stats
- **Total Commands**: 31 (27 root + 4 detailed)
- **Documentation Files**: 11
- **Token Savings**: 87-91% average
- **Best Practices Documented**: 10 major sections
- **Citations**: 28+ authoritative sources
