# Plan: Session History Preservation

## Plan Overview
- **ID**: session-history-001
- **Created**: 2025-01-16
- **Status**: Completed
- **Completed**: 2025-01-16
- **Objective**: Preserve raw Claude Code session transcripts separate from checkpoints

## Problem Statement
- Session history can be lost during context compaction
- No systematic way to preserve raw conversation text
- Historical analysis requires full transcripts, not summaries
- Checkpoints serve different purpose (work resumption vs history)

## Solution Design

### 1. Directory Structure
```
session-history/
├── 2025-01-16/
│   ├── session-001-0830-1030.txt    # Raw transcript
│   ├── session-002-1145-1400.txt    # After compact
│   └── daily-summary.md             
├── index.md                          # Master index
└── README.md                         # Documentation
```

### 2. Components to Create

**A. Session History Command**
- File: `.claude/commands/session-history.md`
- Actions: save, delta, list, archive
- Wrapper around npm scripts

**B. Session History Manager**
- File: `scripts/session-history.js`
- Saves raw text (not markdown)
- Tracks deltas between saves
- Auto-organizes by date

**C. NPM Scripts**
```json
"session:save": "node scripts/session-history.js save",
"session:delta": "node scripts/session-history.js delta",
"session:list": "node scripts/session-history.js list"
```

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Create plans/ directory structure
- [x] Document this plan in plans/session-history-preservation.md
- [x] Document previous plan in plans/completed/learnings-documentation.md
- [x] Create session-history/ directory structure
- [x] Move existing transcript to session-history/2025-01-16/
- [x] Create session-history/README.md
- [x] Create scripts/session-history.js
- [x] Create .claude/commands/session-history.md
- [x] Update package.json with session history npm scripts
- [x] Test session saving functionality
- [x] Update CLAUDE_PATTERNS.md with session preservation
- [x] Update BEST_PRACTICES.md with session intervals
- [x] Add Claude version metadata to saves
- [x] Clarify optional nature of session saving
- [x] Move plan to completed/ with after-action report

## Success Criteria
- [x] Plans directory created and documented
- [x] Raw sessions can be preserved (manual copy required)
- [x] Delta saves minimize storage
- [x] Clear separation from checkpoints
- [x] Easy retrieval of historical sessions
- [x] Claude version metadata captured
- [x] Optional nature clearly documented

## After-Action Report

### Actual vs Planned
- **Planned**: Basic session preservation system
- **Actual**: Full-featured system with metadata, version tracking, and clear optional messaging
- **Exceeded Plan**: Added Claude version tracking, retrospective command integration

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Metadata tracking**: Initially didn't include Claude version info
2. **Optional messaging**: Had to balance clarity with over-communication
3. **Git SHA tracking**: Attempted but wisely reverted (circular dependency issue)
4. **Learn command**: Permission errors with complex bash pipes

### Solutions Applied
1. Added metadata system with .meta.json files
2. Refined optional messaging to be clear but not repetitive
3. Removed SHA tracking after recognizing the design flaw
4. Simplified learn command to avoid permission issues

### Key Learnings
1. **Don't reinvent git**: SHA tracking in files creates circular dependencies
2. **Optional features need clear messaging**: Users shouldn't feel obligated
3. **Living reference balance**: Repository can use features without requiring users to
4. **Metadata is valuable**: Claude version tracking helps with debugging
5. **Permission boundaries matter**: Complex bash commands need approval

### Metrics
- Files created: 7 (scripts, commands, documentation)
- Files updated: 5 (package.json, patterns, best practices)
- Lines of code: ~700
- Features added: save, delta, list, archive, metadata
- Commits: 15+ atomic commits

### Recommendations
1. Consider automated session saving hooks in future
2. Add session compression for long-term storage
3. Build session analysis tools
4. Create session sharing format

## Notes
- User emphasized atomic commits - each file/component gets its own commit
- Session history is distinct from checkpoints (raw preservation vs work state)
- Focus on never losing conversation data
- Living reference principle maintained throughout
