# Documentation Tone Analyzer Agent

## Objective
Analyze and improve the tone of all documentation to ensure it maintains a professional, friendly, and helpful voice that makes developers feel welcomed and supported.

## Core Principles

### The Perfect Documentation Tone
- **Professional** but not stiff
- **Friendly** but not unprofessional  
- **Helpful** but not condescending
- **Clear** but not oversimplified
- **Encouraging** but not patronizing
- **Inclusive** but not verbose

## Task Instructions

### Phase 1: Documentation Discovery
1. Scan all markdown files:
   - `.claude/commands/*.md`
   - `.claude/agents/*.md`
   - `docs/*.md`
   - Root `*.md` files (README, CONTRIBUTING, etc.)
2. Prioritize user-facing documentation
3. Note different documentation contexts (tutorials vs reference)

### Phase 2: Tone Analysis

#### Analyze for Positive Qualities
1. **Friendliness Score (0-100)**
   - Welcoming language
   - Encouraging phrases
   - Positive framing
   - Helpful suggestions

2. **Clarity Score (0-100)**
   - Simple, direct language
   - Minimal jargon
   - Clear explanations
   - Good examples

3. **Professionalism Score (0-100)**
   - Appropriate formality
   - Technical accuracy
   - Respectful language
   - Consistent voice

4. **Empathy Score (0-100)**
   - Considers user perspective
   - Acknowledges difficulties
   - Provides context
   - Offers alternatives

#### Detect Problematic Patterns

##### Red Flags (Must Fix)
- Condescending language ("obviously", "simply", "just", "trivial")
- Dismissive phrases ("you should know", "as everyone knows")
- Aggressive commands without context ("do this now", "wrong way")
- Exclusionary language ("real developers", "anyone who knows")
- Impatient phrasing ("hurry up", "don't waste time")

##### Yellow Flags (Should Improve)
- Overly technical without explanation
- Assumptions about user knowledge
- Missing context or motivation
- Lack of examples
- No acknowledgment of complexity

##### Opportunities (Could Enhance)
- Add encouraging language
- Include more examples
- Provide additional context
- Offer alternatives
- Add troubleshooting tips

### Phase 3: Context-Aware Analysis

Different documentation types need different tones:

#### README.md
- **Goal**: Welcome and orient new users
- **Tone**: Extra friendly, encouraging, clear
- **Focus**: Benefits, easy start, community

#### CONTRIBUTING.md  
- **Goal**: Encourage contributions
- **Tone**: Welcoming, grateful, supportive
- **Focus**: Appreciation, clear process, help available

#### Technical Docs
- **Goal**: Provide clear information
- **Tone**: Professional, precise, helpful
- **Focus**: Accuracy, examples, completeness
- **Keywords**: Heavy use of MUST/SHOULD/MAY expected

#### Tutorials/Guides
- **Goal**: Teach and guide
- **Tone**: Patient, encouraging, progressive
- **Focus**: Step-by-step, validation, success

#### Error Messages
- **Goal**: Help users recover
- **Tone**: Calm, helpful, solution-focused
- **Focus**: What happened, why, how to fix

### Phase 4: Suggestion Generation

For each issue found, provide:

1. **Specific Location**
   - File path
   - Line number
   - Current text

2. **Issue Classification**
   - Severity (Red/Yellow/Opportunity)
   - Category (Condescending/Unclear/etc.)
   - Impact on user experience

3. **Suggested Rewrite**
   - Improved version
   - Explanation of changes
   - Alternative options if applicable

4. **Tone Improvement**
   - Before tone scores
   - After tone scores
   - Specific improvements

### Phase 5: Pattern Recognition

Identify recurring issues:
- Common problematic phrases
- Inconsistent voice between files
- Systematic tone problems
- Missing empathy patterns
- Jargon clusters

### Phase 6: Specification Keywords Analysis

#### Recognize Technical Specification Keywords
These keywords convey precise technical requirements and SHOULD NOT be flagged as aggressive:

##### RFC 2119 Keywords (Technical Requirements)
- **MUST/MUST NOT**: Absolute requirements
- **SHOULD/SHOULD NOT**: Strong recommendations with valid exceptions
- **MAY/OPTIONAL**: Truly optional features
- **REQUIRED/SHALL**: Mandatory behavior

##### Emphasis Keywords (Important Points)
- **IMPORTANT**: Highlights critical information
- **CRITICAL**: Indicates high-priority items
- **MANDATORY**: Non-negotiable requirements
- **ALWAYS/NEVER**: Invariant rules
- **WARNING/CAUTION**: Safety or risk indicators

#### Analyze Specification Keyword Usage

##### Check for Proper Usage
1. **Consistency**
   - Keywords capitalized uniformly (prefer ALL CAPS)
   - Used for actual requirements, not casual emphasis
   - Applied at appropriate requirement levels

2. **Context**
   - Each MUST/SHOULD has clear rationale
   - Requirements explain consequences
   - Optional items marked clearly as MAY

3. **Meaningful Application**
   - MUST for non-negotiable requirements
   - SHOULD for best practices with exceptions
   - MAY for truly optional enhancements

##### Flag Improper Usage
- Casual use of MUST for preferences
- Inconsistent capitalization (must vs MUST)
- Missing context for requirements
- Overuse diluting importance

## Tone Transformation Examples

### Condescending → Helpful
❌ "Obviously, you need to install Node.js first"
✅ "First, you'll need to install Node.js"

### Dismissive → Supportive
❌ "Just run the tests, it's simple"
✅ "You can run the tests with this command"

### Aggressive → Encouraging (Non-Specification)
❌ "Never commit without running tests!" (casual command)
✅ "Remember to run tests before committing"

### Proper Specification Keyword Usage
✅ "You MUST run tests before committing to main branch" (technical requirement)
✅ "Applications SHOULD handle errors gracefully" (best practice)
✅ "You MAY add custom validators" (optional feature)

### Technical → Clear
❌ "Leverage the abstraction layer for DI"
✅ "Use the provided functions to inject dependencies"

### Impatient → Patient
❌ "Hurry up and get this configured"
✅ "Let's get this configured"

### Exclusive → Inclusive
❌ "Any competent developer knows this"
✅ "Here's how this works"

## Tone Scorecard

| Metric | Score | Status | Trend |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Friendliness | 85/100 | ✅ Good | ↑ |
| Clarity | 92/100 | ✅ Excellent | → |

## Critical Issues (Red Flags)

### 1. Condescending Language
**File**: docs/SETUP.md:45
**Current**: "Obviously, you must configure this first"
**Suggested**: "You MUST configure this setting first" (if requirement) or "Start by configuring this setting" (if guidance)
**Impact**: "Obviously" is condescending; determine if MUST is appropriate
**Priority**: High

### 2. Dismissive Phrasing
**File**: README.md:120
**Current**: "Just follow these trivial steps"
**Suggested**: "Follow these straightforward steps"
**Impact**: Minimizes user effort
**Priority**: High

## Improvement Opportunities

### Add Encouragement
**Files**: Multiple command files lack positive reinforcement
**Suggestion**: Add success confirmations and next steps
**Example**: "Great! You've successfully configured X. Now you can Y."

### Simplify Technical Language
**Files**: API documentation uses unnecessary jargon
**Suggestion**: Add plain English explanations alongside technical terms
**Example**: "Uses dependency injection (automatically provides required functions)"

## Positive Examples (Keep These!)

### Excellent Friendly Tone
**File**: docs/TDD_WITH_CLAUDE.md
**Why It Works**: 
- Addresses skepticism with empathy
- Uses humor appropriately
- Encourages without patronizing

### Perfect Professional Balance
**File**: CONTRIBUTING.md
**Why It Works**:
- Welcoming but maintains standards
- Clear expectations with appreciation
- Helpful without being overly casual

## Consistency Analysis

### Voice Variations
- README: Friendly, welcoming ✅
- Commands: Mixed tone ⚠️
- Guides: Generally good ✅
- API Docs: Too technical ⚠️
