# Next Priorities Agent

## Objective
Perform intelligent analysis of the current project state across multiple dimensions (git status, project health, active tasks, development phase) to provide prioritized recommendations for next actions.

## Task Instructions

### Phase 1: Project State Discovery
1. **Repository Analysis**
   - Check git status (uncommitted changes, unpushed commits)
   - Analyze recent commit patterns and activity
   - Identify current branch and synchronization state
   - Review recent development focus areas

2. **Project Health Assessment**
   - Check for critical issues (failing builds, tests, linting)
   - Assess documentation completeness
   - Review dependency status and security
   - Identify technical debt markers

3. **Task Management Analysis**
   - Review ACTIVE_WORK.md for pending tasks
   - Assess task priorities and completion rates
   - Check for stale or blocked tasks
   - Evaluate workload balance

4. **Development Context**
   - Determine project phase (setup, development, maintenance)
   - Analyze code complexity and file organization
   - Identify integration points and dependencies
   - Assess testing coverage and quality

### Phase 2: Intelligent Priority Analysis
1. **Critical Issues Identification**
   - Failing builds or tests (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
   - Uncommitted work at risk of loss
   - Security vulnerabilities or broken dependencies
   - Blocking issues preventing progress

2. **Development Momentum Assessment**
   - Recent activity patterns and focus areas
   - Incomplete features or refactoring
   - Testing gaps in recently changed code
   - Documentation debt for new features

3. **Strategic Opportunities**
   - Architecture improvements that unlock progress
   - Technical debt that's slowing development
   - Testing infrastructure that prevents bugs
   - Documentation that enables collaboration

### Phase 3: Context-Aware Recommendations
1. **Time-Based Optimization**
   - Consider time of day for task complexity matching
   - Account for day of week patterns
   - Suggest batch-friendly vs focus-intensive tasks
   - Align with natural productivity cycles

2. **Skill and Energy Matching**
   - High-focus tasks for peak concentration times
   - Routine tasks for lower-energy periods
   - Learning tasks for curiosity-driven moments
   - Creative tasks for inspiration periods

3. **Project Phase Alignment**
   - Setup phase: Infrastructure and tooling
   - Development phase: Feature implementation and testing
   - Refinement phase: Optimization and polish
   - Maintenance phase: Updates and documentation

### Phase 4: Actionable Recommendations
1. **Immediate Actions (Next 1-2 Hours)**
   - Critical fixes that unblock progress
   - Quick wins that build momentum
   - Routine tasks that clear mental overhead
   - Setup tasks that enable better workflows

2. **Short-term Goals (Next 1-2 Days)**
   - Feature development priorities
   - Testing and quality improvements
   - Documentation and maintenance
   - Technical debt reduction

3. **Strategic Initiatives (Next Week+)**
   - Architecture improvements
   - Major feature planning
   - Tool and process optimization
   - Knowledge sharing and documentation

## Analysis Patterns

### High-Priority Triggers
1. **Build/Test Failures**: Drop everything and fix
2. **Uncommitted Changes**: Risk of work loss
3. **Security Issues**: Dependency vulnerabilities
4. **Blocking Bugs**: Preventing other work

### Development Flow Optimization
1. **Feature Completion**: Finish started work before beginning new
2. **Testing Gaps**: Add tests for recently changed code
3. **Documentation Debt**: Document complex or new features
4. **Refactoring Opportunities**: Clean up after feature addition

### Context Switching Costs
1. **Batch Similar Tasks**: Group related activities
2. **Minimize Context Switches**: Complete logical units
3. **Prepare for Interruptions**: Good stopping points
4. **Knowledge Preservation**: Document complex decisions
