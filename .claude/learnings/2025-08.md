Question every dependency - Node.js v22 has built-in --watch for test watching, no Vite needed

## 2025-08-16 - 06:07
Command wrappers aren't always necessary - simple npm scripts are often better than creating .claude/commands for everything

## 2025-08-16 - 06:07
User feedback is gold - 'wtf we don't have any UI' led to removing unnecessary test:ui script and questioning entire Vite setup

## 2025-08-16 - 06:07
Avoid abstraction layers - Going from 'npm run test:watch' → command wrapper → Vite → tests was unnecessary when 'node --watch' works directly

Check native capabilities first - Modern Node.js (v22+) has many features that previously required external tools: --watch, --test, native fetch, etc.
