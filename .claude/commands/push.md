# Push Command

Safe push workflow with pre-push quality validation, branch management, and remote synchronization.

## Context
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`
- Unpushed commits: !`git rev-list --count @{u}..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "0"`
- Check git status for uncommitted changes
- Run 'git fetch' to check remote status

## Your Task
Execute safe push workflow with quality validation:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

Push Command Help

USAGE:
  /push [command] [target-branch] [--force]

COMMANDS:
  push (default)              Standard push with quality checks
  check, dry-run, validate    Run pre-push checks without pushing
  force, --force, -f          Force push (uses --force-with-lease)
  branch <name>              Push to specific branch
  help                        Show this help

EXAMPLES:
  /push                       Push current branch
  /push check                 Validate without pushing
  /push branch main          Push to main branch
  /push force                Force push current branch

PRE-PUSH CHECKS:
- Uncommitted changes warning
- Build validation (if configured)
- Test execution (if configured)  
- Commit message quality
- Large file detection
- Remote synchronization status

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Uses --force-with-lease for force pushes
- Warns about uncommitted changes
- Validates build and tests before push
- Checks for conflicts with remote

WORKFLOW:
1. /commit to create quality commits
2. /push check to validate readiness
3. /push to execute safe push
4. /hygiene to verify project health

## Features
- **Quality Validation**: Pre-push checks for build, tests, and code quality
- **Safe Force Push**: Uses `--force-with-lease` for safer force operations
- **Branch Management**: Support for pushing to specific branches
- **Conflict Detection**: Warns about remote conflicts before pushing
- **Comprehensive Feedback**: Detailed push summaries and next steps
- **Error Recovery**: Suggests solutions for common push failures

## Safety Measures
- **Pre-push Validation**: Runs build and test checks before pushing
- **Uncommitted Changes**: Warns about uncommitted work
- **Remote Sync Check**: Detects if pull/rebase is needed first
- **Force Push Safety**: Uses `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force`
- **Large File Detection**: Warns about accidentally committing large files
