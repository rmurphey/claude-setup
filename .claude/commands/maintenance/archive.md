# Archive Command

## Purpose
Archive completed designs, implementations, and development phases while capturing comprehensive insights and lessons learned.

## Behavior
When `/archive` is executed, perform the following systematic process:

### 1. Analyze Completed Work
- Review `ACTIVE_WORK.md` to identify completed phases or major achievements
- Identify designs in `designs/` directory that have been fully implemented
- Look for sections marked as "âœ… Complete" or "Recently Completed"
- Assess which work represents significant milestones worth archiving

### 2. Create Comprehensive Archive Documents
For each completed work item, create detailed archive documents in `archive/` directory containing:

**Technical Implementation**:
- Complete implementation details and code references
- Technical achievements and metrics
- Architecture decisions and patterns used
- Integration points and dependencies

**Business Impact**:
- Business metrics and validation results
- User experience improvements
- Strategic value delivered
- Success criteria validation

**Development Insights**:
- Lessons learned and architectural insights
- High-ROI development patterns identified
- Technical decisions and rationale
- Challenges overcome and solutions found

**Knowledge Preservation**:
- Patterns for future reuse
- Best practices discovered
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Framework evolution insights

### 3. Update ACTIVE_WORK.md
- Clean up completed sections from detailed descriptions
- Replace with concise references to archived documents
- Maintain focus on current priorities and next steps
- Preserve project momentum and clarity

### 4. Update Project Documentation
- Update `README.md` to reference new archive locations
- Update `CLAUDE.md` documentation structure section
- Ensure archive directory is properly linked and discoverable
- Maintain clear separation between current and completed work

### 5. Preserve Development Knowledge
- Capture development patterns and strategies
- Document high-impact technical decisions
- Record business intelligence insights
- Create knowledge base for future development phases

## Archive Document Structure
Each archive document should include:

```markdown
# [Feature/Phase Name] Archive

## Overview
[Brief summary and status]

## Implementation Achievements
[Technical details and code references]

## Business Impact
[Metrics, validation, strategic value]

## Technical Insights
[Architectural decisions and patterns]

## Success Metrics
[Quantifiable achievements]

## Lessons Learned
[Key insights and patterns for future]

## References
[Links to designs, commits, discussions]
```

## Expected Outcomes
- Clean, focused ACTIVE_WORK.md
- Comprehensive knowledge preservation
- Searchable development history
- Reusable patterns and insights
- Clear project progression documentation
