description: Capture insights and learnings from development work
---

# Learn Command

Capture and organize insights, learnings, and knowledge gained during development work for future reference and team sharing.

## Context
- Learning entries: !`find . -name "LEARNINGS.md" -o -name ".claude/learnings/*" | wc -l | xargs`+ files
- Recent insights: !`grep -c "^##" LEARNINGS.md 2>/dev/null || echo "0"`+ topics
- Last entry: !`tail -1 LEARNINGS.md 2>/dev/null | grep "Date:" | cut -d: -f2 | xargs || echo "none"`

## Your Task
Document insights, discoveries, and learnings for knowledge retention and sharing:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Parse command arguments
COMMAND="${1:-interactive}"
shift
ARGS="$*"

# Ensure learnings directory exists
mkdir -p .claude/learnings

case "$COMMAND" in
  "add"|"new"|"capture")
    if [ -z "$ARGS" ]; then
      echo "‚ùå Please provide a learning topic or insight"
      echo "Usage: /learn add <insight or topic>"
      exit 1
    fi
    
    INSIGHT="$ARGS"
    DATE=$(date '+%Y-%m-%d')
    TIME=$(date '+%H:%M')
    
    echo "üìù Capturing learning: $INSIGHT"
    
    # Create or update LEARNINGS.md
    if [ ! -f "LEARNINGS.md" ]; then
      cat > LEARNINGS.md << 'EOF'
# Project Learnings

Captured insights, discoveries, and knowledge gained during development.
