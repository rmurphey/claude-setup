# Claude Usage Estimation

Get personalized, context-aware estimates for Claude usage based on your project and development patterns.

## Your Task
Use the usage-estimator agent for personalized estimation:

**For general usage estimates:**
```
Use the usage-estimator agent to analyze my project and provide Claude usage estimates for [specific task type].
```

**For specific task estimation:**
```
Use the usage-estimator agent to estimate Claude usage for: [detailed description of your planned work]
```

## What the Agent Provides
- **Project-Aware Estimates**: Analyzes your specific codebase and complexity
- **Historical Calibration**: Uses your past session data to improve accuracy
- **Context Adjustments**: Factors in technology stack, project phase, and your experience
- **Confidence Ranges**: Provides conservative, likely, and optimistic estimates
- **Efficiency Recommendations**: Suggests ways to optimize your Claude usage

## When to Use
- Planning new features or major changes
- Budgeting Claude usage for projects
- Comparing different implementation approaches
- Setting realistic timeline expectations
- Optimizing development workflows

## Example Scenarios
- "Estimate adding user authentication to my React app"
- "How much Claude usage for test coverage of my API?"
- "Cost of refactoring my legacy JavaScript to TypeScript"
- "Daily usage patterns for my development style"

## Philosophy
Estimation requires **intelligent analysis** of project context, user patterns, and task complexity - exactly what agents excel at. The agent provides personalized, data-driven estimates that simple commands cannot.
