Implements the red-green-refactor cycle for test-driven development, helping you write better code through test-first methodology.

## Context
- Test framework: !`grep -E "jest|mocha|vitest|pytest|rspec" package.json 2>/dev/null | head -1 | grep -o '"[^"]*"' | head -1 | tr -d '"' || echo "not detected"`
- Test files: !`find . -name "*.test.*" -o -name "*.spec.*" | grep -v node_modules | wc -l | xargs`+ test files
- Coverage: !`[ -f coverage/coverage-summary.json ] && grep -o '"pct":[0-9.]*' coverage/coverage-summary.json | head -1 | cut -d: -f2 || echo "unknown"`%
- Last test run: !`git log -1 --format="%cr" --grep="test" 2>/dev/null || echo "unknown"`

## Your Task

Test-Driven Development (TDD) Command

USAGE:
  /tdd [phase] [feature-name] [options]

PHASES:
  start, begin         Start RED phase - write failing test
  green, implement     Start GREEN phase - make test pass
  refactor, improve    Start REFACTOR phase - improve code
  cycle, next         Start next TDD cycle
  status, check       Check test status and coverage
  tips               Show TDD best practices

WORKFLOW:
  1. RED: Write a failing test
  2. GREEN: Write minimal code to pass
  3. REFACTOR: Improve code quality
  4. REPEAT: Start next cycle

EXAMPLES:
  /tdd start login          # Start TDD for login feature
  /tdd green login          # Implement login to pass test
  /tdd refactor login       # Refactor login implementation
  /tdd status              # Check test coverage
  /tdd tips                # Show best practices

BENEFITS:
- Better code design through test-first thinking
- Immediate feedback on code correctness
- Built-in regression test suite
- Improved code confidence
- Natural documentation through tests

Based on industry best practices and proven TDD methodology.

### Quality Metrics
- Test file counting
- Test-to-source ratio calculation
- Coverage reporting integration
- Test execution status

### Best Practices Built-in
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test guidance
- Small cycle recommendations
- Commit point reminders

## Why TDD with Claude?

As noted in best practices:
> "The robots LOVE TDD. Seriously. With TDD you have the robot friend build out the test, and the mock. Then your next prompt you build the mock to be real. It is the most effective counter to hallucination and LLM scope drift."

This command helps enforce disciplined TDD practice, reducing AI hallucination and improving code quality.

## Integration with Other Commands

Works seamlessly with:
- `/commit` - Commit after each phase
- `/hygiene` - Verify project health
- `/todo` - Track TDD tasks
- `/learn` - Capture TDD insights
