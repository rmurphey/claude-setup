## What This Is

This is a **working reference repository** that demonstrates an opinionated set of practices for Claude Code development. The commands in `.claude/commands/` are actively used in this repository's development, making it a living example of the patterns it teaches.

## Quick Start (Choose Your Method)

### Method 1: Direct Use via NPX (No Installation)
```bash
# Try the tools without installing anything
npx claude-setup                     # Initialize in current project
npx claude-setup learn add "insight" # Capture a learning
npx claude-setup tdd start           # Start TDD workflow
npx claude-setup docs                # Analyze documentation
npx claude-setup monitor status      # Check repo health
```

### Method 2: Global Installation
```bash
# Install globally for frequent use
npm install -g claude-setup
claude-setup          # Initialize commands
claude-learn add "insight"
claude-tdd start

## 🤖 Claude Code Agents

**When commands aren't enough, agents provide intelligent analysis and complex automation.**

### Commands vs Agents
- **Commands**: Routine tasks you do the same way every time (`/hygiene`, `/commit`)
- **Agents**: Complex analysis requiring "intelligence" and decision-making

### Available Agents

#### 📊 Analysis & Optimization
- **`command-analyzer`** - Analyzes command usage patterns and suggests optimizations
- **`session-insights`** - Extracts patterns from development session history  
- **`documentation-auditor`** - Audits documentation completeness and consistency
- **`repo-quality-auditor`** - Comprehensive repository audit for completeness and conflicts

#### 🎯 Planning & Guidance
- **`next-priorities`** - Analyzes project state to recommend next development priorities
- **`usage-estimator`** - Provides intelligent Claude usage estimates for development tasks

#### 🧪 Testing & Quality
- **`test-coverage-advisor`** - Identifies untested code and recommends testing opportunities
- **`agent-auditor`** - Audits other agents for quality, correctness, and relevance

### When to Use Agents
Use agents when you need:
- 🧠 **Analysis**: Analysis across multiple files with pattern recognition
- 📈 **Insights**: Deep understanding of your development practices
- 🔧 **Optimization**: Strategic improvements to your workflows
- 📋 **Planning**: Custom workflows for complex, multi-step processes
- 🤖 **Self-Maintenance**: Automated quality audits via GitHub Actions

### Quick Examples
```bash
# Use a command for routine tasks
/hygiene

# Use an agent for analysis
"Use the session-insights agent to analyze my development patterns from the last 3 months"

# Use an agent for optimization  
"Use the command-analyzer agent to find opportunities to streamline my command library"
```

**📖 See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the complete guide on when and why to use agents vs commands.**

## Development Method

This repository uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) which helps Claude write focused, correct code. 
See [TDD with Claude Guide](docs/TDD_WITH_CLAUDE.md) for why it works so well with AI assistance.

## Real-World Usage Examples

### This Repository Uses Its Own Commands

Explore our git history to see these commands in action:
```bash
git log --grep="Generated with Claude Code" --oneline
```

Check our project health:
```bash
# In Claude Code
/hygiene
```

See our active work:
```bash
npm run todo:list  # Shows open GitHub issues
```

## Example Workflow

```bash
/hygiene                          # Check project health
/tdd start "new feature"          # Start with tests
/commit feat "add user auth"      # Quality-checked commit
/learn "TDD clarified the API"    # Capture insights
```

👉 **[See Complete Workflows Guide](docs/WORKFLOWS.md)** for detailed development patterns

## Customization Guide

### Adapting Commands to Your Needs

All commands are customizable markdown files in `.claude/commands/`. Common customizations:

#### Adjust Quality Thresholds
Edit `/hygiene` command to match your standards:
```bash
# In .claude/commands/hygiene.md
# Change from "max-warnings 10" to your preference
npx eslint . --max-warnings 0  # Strict: no warnings
```

#### Add Project-Specific Checks
Extend commands with your tools:
```bash
# In .claude/commands/commit.md
# Add your specific checks
npm run typecheck
npm run your-custom-check
```

#### Create Custom Commands
Copy any template as a starting point:
```bash
cp .claude/commands/hygiene.md .claude/commands/deploy.md
# Edit to create deployment workflow
```

## Command Categories

### 🏃 Quick Actions (< 1 min)
`/todo`, `/next`, `/hygiene`

### 📝 Documentation & Learning
`/docs`, `/learn`, `/retrospective`

### 🔧 Development Workflow
`/commit`, `/push`, `/tdd`

## Understanding Command Templates

Each command is a structured markdown file that guides Claude through specific workflows:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, Write]  # Tools Claude can use
description: Brief command description
---

# Command Name

Detailed instructions for Claude to execute...

When you type `/<command>` in Claude Code:
1. Claude reads the template from `.claude/commands/<command>.md`
2. Executes the workflow described in the template
3. Uses only the allowed tools specified
4. Provides consistent, professional assistance
```

## Tips for Success

### 🎯 Start Small
Begin with core commands: `/hygiene`, `/todo`, `/commit`

### 📊 Track Progress
Use `/todo` and `/next` to maintain focus

### 🔄 Regular Health Checks
Run `/hygiene` before and after major changes

### 💡 Capture Learnings
Use `/learn` to build project knowledge base

### 🎨 Customize Gradually
Adapt templates as you learn what works for your team

## Advanced Usage

### Continuous Testing
Run tests automatically as you code:
```bash
npm run test:watch    # Node.js watch mode - reruns on file changes
```

### Chaining Commands
```bash
/hygiene && /todo list && /next
# Full status check → task list → recommendations
```

### Command Aliases
Create shortcuts for common workflows:
```bash
# In .claude/commands/status.md
# Combine hygiene + todo + next into one command
```

### CI/CD Integration
Use command patterns in your automation:
```bash
# In .github/workflows/ci.yml
# Implement same checks as /hygiene command
```
