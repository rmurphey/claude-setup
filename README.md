# Claude Code Project Setup

Interactive CLI tool to set up professional development projects with Claude Code integration, quality infrastructure, and custom commands.

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, you need these programs installed on your computer:

### Required (Must Have)
- **Node.js** (version 16 or newer)
  - Download from: https://nodejs.org
  - Choose the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version
  - This includes `npm` and `npx` commands automatically
- **Git** (any recent version)
  - Download from: https://git-scm.com
  - On Mac: Often pre-installed, or install via Xcode Command Line Tools
  - On Windows: Download Git for Windows
  - On Linux: Install via your package manager (`sudo apt install git`)

### How to Check if You Have Them
Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
node --version    # Should show v16.0.0 or higher
npm --version     # Should show some version number
git --version     # Should show some version number
```

If any command says "command not found" or "not recognized", you need to install that program.

### For Specific Project Types
After running the setup tool, you may need to install additional tools:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Node.js covers this (already required above)
- **Python**: Install Python 3.8+ from https://python.org
- **Go**: Install from https://golang.org
- **Rust**: Install from https://rustup.rs
- **Java**: Install JDK 11+ from https://adoptium.net

Don't worry - the tool will tell you exactly what to install for your specific project type!

## Getting Started for Beginners

### What is a Terminal/Command Prompt?
- **Windows**: Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell" in Start Menu
- **Mac**: Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight (Cmd+Space)
- **Linux**: Look for "Terminal" in your applications

### Step-by-Step First Use
1. **Install Node.js and Git** (see Prerequisites above)
2. **Open your terminal/command prompt**
3. **Navigate to where you want your project**:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop                    # Go to Desktop
   mkdir my-new-project         # Create a new folder
   cd my-new-project           # Go into that folder
   ```
4. **Run the setup tool**:
   ```bash
   npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup
   ```
5. **Answer the 4 questions** that appear
6. **Follow the instructions** the tool gives you
7. **Start coding!** All the professional tools are set up for you

### What the Tool Does for You
- ✅ Creates all the configuration files your project needs
- ✅ Sets up quality checking tools (finds bugs and formatting issues)
- ✅ Creates documentation templates
- ✅ Initializes version control (Git) so you can track changes
- ✅ Sets up helpful commands for working with Claude Code
- ✅ Makes your project look professional from day one

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run directly with npx (recommended)
npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup

# Or clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/rmurphey/claude-setup.git
cd claude-setup && npm link
claude-setup
```

## What It Does

This tool sets up a complete professional development environment through 4 simple questions:

1. **Project Type** - JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, or Mixed
2. **Quality Level** - Strict (0 warnings), Standard (<10 warnings), or Relaxed (<50 warnings)  
3. **Team Size** - Solo, Small team, or Large team
4. **CI/CD** - Whether to create GitHub Actions workflows

**Always includes git repository initialization and initial commit.**

## Installation

### NPX Usage (Recommended)
```bash
# Run once in any project directory
npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup
```

**Why NPX?**
- ✅ Always runs the latest version
- ✅ No global installation clutter  
- ✅ Perfect for one-time project setup
- ✅ Works in any directory immediately

### Alternative Methods

#### Global Installation
```bash
npm install -g github:rmurphey/claude-setup
claude-setup
```

#### Local Development
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmurphey/claude-setup.git
cd claude-setup
npm install
npm link
claude-setup
```

## Usage Examples

### New JavaScript Project
```bash
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup
# Select: JavaScript/TypeScript → Standard → Solo → No CI/CD
# Git repo initialized automatically with initial commit
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### Existing Python Project
```bash
cd existing-python-project
npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup
# Select: Python → Strict → Team → Yes CI/CD
```

### Enterprise Setup
```bash
cd enterprise-project
npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup
# Select: Java → Strict → Team → Yes CI/CD
```

## Quality Levels

### Strict
- **0 warnings allowed**
- 70% test coverage target
- All commits must pass quality gates
- Maximum automation and enforcement

### Standard
- **<10 warnings** (Green), 10-25 (Yellow), 25+ (Red)
- 50% test coverage minimum
- Errors block commits, warnings allowed
- Balanced approach for most teams

### Relaxed
- **<50 warnings** acceptable
- 30% test coverage minimum
- Only errors block commits
- Suitable for rapid prototyping

## After Setup

### Verify Installation

# Check project health
/hygiene

# View available commands
cat COMMANDS.md

# Review AI guidelines
cat CLAUDE.md
```

### Next Steps
1. Install language-specific dependencies as instructed
2. Run initial quality checks
3. Review and customize CLAUDE.md for your project
4. Start development with `/todo "first task"`

## Philosophy

**Prevention Over Cure**: Setting up quality infrastructure from project start is exponentially cheaper than fixing quality debt later.

**Universal Principles**: The same patterns work across all languages - complexity limits, documentation standards, and quality thresholds are language-agnostic.

**Interactive Over Manual**: Conversational setup is better than complex written instructions.

**Command-Driven Development**: Custom commands enable consistent Claude Code interaction patterns.

## Troubleshooting

### "npx: command not found"
- **Solution**: Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org (includes npx)
- **Check**: Run `node --version` to verify installation

### "git: command not found" 
- **Solution**: Install Git from https://git-scm.com
- **Mac users**: Try `xcode-select --install` first
- **Check**: Run `git --version` to verify installation

### "Permission denied" errors
- **Windows**: Try running command prompt as Administrator
- **Mac/Linux**: Try adding `sudo` before the command (be careful!)
- **Alternative**: Use the local installation method instead

### "Module not found" or weird errors
- **Solution**: Clear NPX cache and try again:
  ```bash
  npx clear-npx-cache
  npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup
  ```

### Setup seems to hang or freeze
- **Solution**: Press `Ctrl+C` to cancel, then try again
- **Check**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection

### "Failed to create initial commit"
- **Solution**: Configure git first:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
  ```

### Still having trouble?
1. Try the local installation method (see Installation section)
2. Check that your terminal can access the internet
3. Make sure you're in the directory where you want to create your project
