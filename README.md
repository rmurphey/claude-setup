## Codebase Recovery System

The Recovery mode provides comprehensive analysis and improvement capabilities for existing projects with quality debt or maintenance challenges.

### How Recovery Mode Works
```bash
cd existing-messy-project
npx github:rmurphey/claude-setup
# Select: 🏥 Assess and recover existing codebase
# Installs recovery command suite
```

### Recovery Commands

**`/recovery-assess`** - **Codebase Health Analysis**
- Analyzes code complexity, test coverage, documentation quality
- Generates comprehensive health score (0-100)
- Identifies technical debt hotspots and improvement priorities
- Creates detailed assessment reports

**`/recovery-plan`** - **Improvement Roadmap Generation**
- Creates prioritized improvement plan based on assessment
- Estimates effort and impact for each improvement
- Provides step-by-step implementation guidance
- Tracks progress across multiple improvement cycles

**`/recovery-execute`** - **Automated Improvements**
- Implements automated fixes for common issues
- Sets up quality infrastructure (linting, testing, formatting)
- Creates missing documentation templates
- Establishes development standards and workflows

### Recovery Workflow
1. **Assessment** → Run `/recovery-assess` to understand current state
2. **Planning** → Use `/recovery-plan` to create improvement roadmap  
3. **Execution** → Apply `/recovery-execute` for automated improvements
4. **Iteration** → Repeat cycle to continuously improve codebase health

### Use Cases
- **Legacy codebases** with accumulated technical debt
- **Inherited projects** without clear standards
- **Rapid prototypes** that need production-ready infrastructure
- **Team transitions** requiring consistent development practices

The recovery system transforms chaotic codebases into maintainable, well-documented projects with professional development standards.

## Quality Levels

### Strict
- **0 warnings allowed**
- 70% test coverage target
- All commits must pass quality gates
- Maximum automation and enforcement

### Standard
- **<10 warnings** (Green), 10-25 (Yellow), 25+ (Red)
- 50% test coverage minimum
- Errors block commits, warnings allowed
- Balanced approach for most teams

### Relaxed
- **<50 warnings** acceptable
- 30% test coverage minimum
- Only errors block commits
- Suitable for rapid prototyping

## Ongoing Development Record System

### How It Works Together

The documentation templates and custom commands create a **persistent development intelligence system**:

1. **Session Continuity**: `ACTIVE_WORK.md` maintains state between Claude Code sessions
2. **Progressive Intelligence**: Commands update documentation files, building project knowledge over time
3. **Quality Automation**: `/hygiene` provides real-time project health based on accumulated metrics
4. **Learning Capture**: `/learn` and `/reflect` commands document insights and patterns
5. **Adaptive Recommendations**: `/next` suggests priorities based on project history and current state

### Development Flow Example

```bash
# Start development session
/hygiene                    # Check current project health
/todo "implement user auth" # Add task to ACTIVE_WORK.md

# During development
/learn "API mocking reduces test complexity"  # Capture insight
/commit                     # Quality-checked commit with co-author

# End of session
/reflect                    # Weekly development review
/defer "mobile optimization" # Move non-critical items
```

### Intelligence Accumulation

Over time, your project builds:
- **Pattern Recognition**: What causes issues in your specific project
- **Quality Trends**: How metrics change over development cycles
- **Collaboration Insights**: How AI assistance patterns evolve
- **Technical Debt Tracking**: Deferred items and their impact on velocity

This transforms Claude Code from a one-time conversation tool into a **persistent development partner** that maintains context, learns from your project's evolution, and provides increasingly intelligent recommendations.

## After Setup

## Philosophy

**Prevention Over Cure**: Setting up quality infrastructure from project start is exponentially cheaper than fixing quality debt later.

**Universal Principles**: The same patterns work across all languages - complexity limits, documentation standards, and quality thresholds are language-agnostic.

**Interactive Over Manual**: Conversational setup is better than complex written instructions.

**Command-Driven Development**: Custom commands enable consistent Claude Code interaction patterns.

## Development & CI/CD

### Running Tests Locally
```bash
npm test                 # Run test suite
npm run test:watch       # Watch mode for development
npm run test:coverage    # Generate coverage report
```

### Continuous Integration
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on push/PR to main branch
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Tests across Node.js 16.x, 18.x, and 20.x
- **Test Coverage**: Automated coverage reporting via Codecov
- **Quality Gates**: ESLint and Jest must pass before merge
