## üéØ Repository Philosophy: Teaching Through Balance

This repository demonstrates various ways of setting up Claude Code commands, including methods that limit token usage. You'll see these three methods:

| Approach | Token Cost | Best For | Example |
|----------|------------|----------|---------|
| **Direct Implementation** | ~2000 tokens | Learning patterns, one-off tasks, custom logic | Claude analyzes and formats commits directly |
| **Script Delegation** | ~100 tokens | Repetitive tasks, stable operations | `npm run lint` instead of manual checks |
| **Hybrid Approach** | ~500 tokens | Complex orchestration, intelligent automation | Script collects data, Claude makes decisions |

### When to Use Each Approach

**Use Direct Implementation when:**
- Teaching or learning new patterns
- Solving unique, one-time problems
- Customization is more valuable than efficiency
- You need to see Claude's problem-solving process

**Use Script Delegation when:**
- The task is repetitive and well-defined
- The logic rarely changes
- Speed and consistency matter more than flexibility
- You're doing the same thing multiple times per session

**Use Hybrid Approach when:**
- You need both efficiency and intelligence
- The task has stable parts and variable parts
- You want to leverage existing tools with AI judgment
- Real-world complexity requires both patterns

Each command in this repository includes metadata showing its approach and typical token usage, helping you understand the real costs and benefits of different patterns.

## ü§ñ Claude Code Agents

**When commands aren't enough, agents provide intelligent analysis and complex automation.**

### Commands vs Agents
- **Commands**: Routine tasks you do the same way every time (`/hygiene`, `/commit`)
- **Agents**: Complex analysis requiring "intelligence" and decision-making

### Available Agents

#### üìä Analysis & Optimization
- **`command-analyzer`** - Analyzes command usage patterns and suggests optimizations
- **`session-insights`** - Extracts patterns from development session history  
- **`documentation-auditor`** - Audits documentation completeness and consistency
- **`repo-quality-auditor`** - Comprehensive repository audit for completeness and conflicts

#### üéØ Planning & Guidance
- **`next-priorities`** - Analyzes project state to recommend next development priorities
- **`usage-estimator`** - Provides intelligent Claude usage estimates for development tasks

#### üß™ Testing & Quality
- **`test-coverage-advisor`** - Identifies untested code and recommends testing opportunities
- **`agent-auditor`** - Audits other agents for quality, correctness, and relevance

### When to Use Agents
Use agents when you need:
- üß† **Analysis**: Analysis across multiple files with pattern recognition
- üìà **Insights**: Deep understanding of your development practices
- üîß **Optimization**: Strategic improvements to your workflows
- üìã **Planning**: Custom workflows for complex, multi-step processes
- ü§ñ **Self-Maintenance**: Automated quality audits via GitHub Actions

### Quick Examples
```bash
# Use a command for routine tasks
/hygiene

# Use an agent for analysis
"Use the session-insights agent to analyze my development patterns from the last 3 months"

# Use an agent for optimization  
"Use the command-analyzer agent to find opportunities to streamline my command library"
```

**üìñ See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the complete guide on when and why to use agents vs commands.**

## Development Method

This repository uses Test-Driven Development (TDD) which helps Claude write focused, correct code. 
See [TDD with Claude Guide](docs/TDD_WITH_CLAUDE.md) for why it works so well with AI assistance.

```

## Customization Guide

### Adapting Commands to Your Needs

All commands are customizable markdown files in `.claude/commands/`. Common customizations:

#### Adjust Quality Thresholds
Edit `/hygiene` command to match your standards:
```bash
# In .claude/commands/hygiene.md
# Change from "max-warnings 10" to your preference
npx eslint . --max-warnings 0  # Strict: no warnings
```

#### Add Project-Specific Checks
Extend commands with your tools:
```bash
# In .claude/commands/commit.md
# Add your specific checks
npm run typecheck
npm run your-custom-check
```

#### Create Custom Commands
Copy any template as a starting point:
```bash
cp .claude/commands/hygiene.md .claude/commands/deploy.md
# Edit to create deployment workflow
```

## Command Categories

### üèÉ Quick Actions (< 1 min)
`/todo`, `/next`, `/hygiene`

### üìù Documentation & Learning
`/docs`, `/learn`, `/retrospective`

### üîß Development Workflow

## Understanding Command Templates

Each command is a structured markdown file that guides Claude through specific workflows:

```markdown
---
allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, Write]  # Tools Claude can use
description: Brief command description
---

# Command Name

Detailed instructions for Claude to execute...

When you type `/<command>` in Claude Code:
1. Claude reads the template from `.claude/commands/<command>.md`
2. Executes the workflow described in the template
3. Uses only the allowed tools specified
4. Provides consistent, professional assistance
